this book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with the coherence of
theism and was concluded with faith and reason in this
work swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the
existence of god his arguments which are somewhat tendentious and rely
upon the imputation of late th century western christian values and
aesthetics to a god which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived were
decisively rejected in mackie s the miracle of theism in the revised
edition of the existence of god swinburne includes an appendix in which he
makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut mackie j l mackie the miracle of theism oxford
this posthumous volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal
arguments for and against the existence of god it ranges from the classical
philosophical positions of descartes anselm berkeley hume et al through
the moral arguments of newman kant and sidgwick to the recent restatements
of the classical theses by plantinga and swinburne it also addresses those
positions which push the concept of god beyond the realm of the rational such as those of kierkegaard kung and philips as well as replacements for
god such as lelie s axiarchism the book is a delight to read less

alt atheism archive name introduction begin pgp signed message an introduction to atheism by mathew this article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism whilst i
have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues you
should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint i
would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions some
relevant books are listed in a companion article to provide a sense of cohesion and progression i have presented this article
as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist all the
questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped
up repeatedly on alt atheism since the newsgroup was created some other
frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions
posed from a christian viewpoint this is because the faq files reflect
questions which have actually been asked and it is predominantly christians
who proselytize on alt atheism so when i talk of religion i am talking primarily about religions such as
christianity judaism and islam which involve some sort of superhuman divine
being much of the discussion will apply to other religions but some of it
may not what is atheism atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of god some atheists go further and believe that god does not exist the former is
often referred to as the weak atheist position and the latter as strong
atheism it is important to note the difference between these two positions weak
atheism is simple scepticism disbelief in the existence of god strong
atheism is a positive belief that god does not exist please do not
fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are strong atheists some atheists believe in the non existence of all gods others limit their
atheism to specific gods such as the christian god rather than making
flat out denials but isn t disbelieving in god the same thing as believing he doesn t exist definitely not disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe
it to be true not believing that something is true is not equivalent to
believing that it is false one may simply have no idea whether it is true or
not which brings us to agnosticism what is agnosticism then the term agnosticism was coined by professor huxley at a meeting of the
metaphysical society in he defined an agnostic as someone who
disclaimed strong atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things
must be some cause unknown and unknowable thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for
sure whether god exists words are slippery things and language is inexact beware of assuming that
you can work out someone s philosophical point of view simply from the fact
that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic for example many people
use agnosticism to mean weak atheism and use the word atheism only when
referring to strong atheism beware also that because the word atheist has so many shades of meaning it
is very difficult to generalize about atheists about all you can say for
sure is that atheists don t believe in god for example it certainly isn t
the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out
about the universe so what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism there are many philosophical justifications for atheism to find out why a
particular person chooses to be an atheist it s best to ask her many atheists feel that the idea of god as presented by the major religions
is essentially self contradictory and that it is logically impossible that
such a god could exist others are atheists through scepticism because they
see no evidence that god exists but isn t it impossible to prove the non existence of something there are many counter examples to such a statement for example it is
quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than
all other prime numbers of course this deals with well defined objects
obeying well defined rules whether gods or universes are similarly
well defined is a matter for debate however assuming for the moment that the existence of a god is not provably
impossible there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non existence of
god if we assume that something does not exist it is always possible to
show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter example if on the other hand we assume that something does exist and if the thing in
question is not provably impossible showing that the assumption is invalid
may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing
might be found to show that it isn t there such an exhaustive search is
often impractical or impossible there is no such problem with largest
primes because we can prove that they don t exist therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist
unless we have evidence that they do even theists follow this rule most of
the time they don t believe in unicorns even though they can t conclusively
prove that no unicorns exist anywhere to assume that god exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be
tested we cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere god might be to
prove that he doesn t exist anywhere so the sceptical atheist assumes by
default that god does not exist since that is an assumption we can test those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of god
exists instead they generally restrict their claims so as to cover
varieties of god described by followers of various religions so whilst it
may be impossible to prove conclusively that no god exists it may be
possible to prove that say a god as described by a particular religious
book does not exist it may even be possible to prove that no god described
by any present day religion exists in practice believing that no god described by any religion exists is very
close to believing that no god exists however it is sufficiently different
that counter arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of
god are not really applicable but what if god is essentially non detectable if god interacts with our universe in any way the effects of his interaction
must be measurable hence his interaction with our universe must be
detectable if god is essentially non detectable it must therefore be the case that he
does not interact with our universe in any way many atheists would argue
that if god does not interact with our universe at all it is of no
importance whether he exists or not if the bible is to be believed god was easily detectable by the israelites surely he should still be detectable today note that i am not demanding that god interact in a scientifically
verifiable physical way it must surely be possible to perceive some
effect caused by his presence though otherwise how can i distinguish him
from all the other things that don t exist ok you may think there s a philosophical justification for atheism but isn t it still a religious belief one of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is the
redefinition game the cynical view of this game is as follows person a begins by making a contentious statement when person b points out
that it can t be true person a gradually re defines the words he used in the
statement until he arrives at something person b is prepared to accept he
then records the statement along with the fact that person b has agreed to
it and continues eventually a uses the statement as an agreed fact but
uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure
redefinitions originally needed to get b to agree to it rather than be seen
to be apparently inconsistent b will tend to play along the point of this digression is that the answer to the question isn t
atheism a religious belief depends crucially upon what is meant by religious religion is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman
controlling power especially in some sort of god and by faith and
worship it s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of buddhism are not religion according to such a definition atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power nor is it
categorized by worship in any meaningful sense widening the definition of religious to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of
human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as religious as well such as
science politics and watching tv ok so it s not a religion but surely belief in atheism or science is still just an act of faith like religion is firstly it s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one
actually believes in secondly it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to
make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience most atheists
try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible and even those are subject to
questioning if experience throws them into doubt science has a number of core assumptions for example it is generally
assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers these are
the sort of core assumptions atheists make if such basic ideas are called acts of faith then almost everything we know must be said to be based on
acts of faith and the term loses its meaning faith is more often used to refer to complete certain belief in something according to such a definition atheism and science are certainly not acts of
faith of course individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as
religious followers when claiming that something is certain this is not a
general tendency however there are many atheists who would be reluctant to
state with certainty that the universe exists faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof sceptical atheism certainly doesn t fit that definition as sceptical atheism
has no beliefs strong atheism is closer but still doesn t really match as
even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data or
the lack of it when asserting that god does not exist if atheism is not religious surely it s anti religious it is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either for or against friend or enemy the truth is not so clear cut atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism in that sense it can be said to be anti religion however when religious believers
speak of atheists being anti religious they usually mean that the atheists
have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists this categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum most atheists take a live and let live attitude unless questioned they
will not usually mention their atheism except perhaps to close friends of
course this may be in part because atheism is not socially acceptable in
many countries a few atheists are quite anti religious and may even try to convert others
when possible historically such anti religious atheists have made little
impact on society outside the eastern bloc countries to digress slightly the soviet union was originally dedicated to separation
of church and state just like the usa soviet citizens were legally free to
worship as they wished the institution of state atheism came about when
stalin took control of the soviet union and tried to destroy the churches in
order to gain complete power over the population some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs but only where they see
religion encroaching on matters which are not its business for example the government of the usa such individuals are usually concerned that
church and state should remain separate but if you don t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state surely that s the same as state atheism the principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall
not legislate concerning matters of religious belief in particular it
means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of
another but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in
nature religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters for
example religious believers have historically been responsible for
encouraging many political reforms even today many organizations
campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as
religious campaigns so long as they campaign concerning secular matters and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds most atheists
are quite happy to see them have their say what about prayer in schools if there s no god why do you care if people pray because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers and tend to do things
that those who don t pray can t just ignore also christian prayer in
schools is intimidating to non christians even if they are told that they
need not join in the diversity of religious and non religious belief means
that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be
acceptable to all those present at any public event also non prayers tend to have friends and family who pray it is reasonable
to care about friends and family wasting their time even without other
motives you mentioned christians who campaign for increased foreign aid what about atheists why aren t there any atheist charities or hospitals don t atheists object to the religious charities there are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can
contribute to some atheists contribute to religious charities as well for
the sake of the practical good they do some atheists even do voluntary work
for charities founded on a theistic basis most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn t worth shouting about in
connection with charity to them atheism is just a simple obvious everyday
matter and so is charity many feel that it s somewhat cheap not to say
self righteous to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set
of religious beliefs to weak atheists building a hospital to say i do not believe in god is a
rather strange idea it s rather like holding a party to say today is not my
birthday why the fuss atheism is rarely evangelical you said atheism isn t anti religious but is it perhaps a backlash against one s upbringing a way of rebelling perhaps it is for some but many people have parents who do not attempt to
force any religious or atheist ideas upon them and many of those people
choose to call themselves atheists it s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a
backlash against an atheist upbringing as a way of being different on the
other hand many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the
expectations of others on the whole we can t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are
backlash or conformism although in general people have a tendency to go
along with a group rather than act or think independently how do atheists differ from religious people they don t believe in god that s all there is to it atheists may listen to heavy metal backwards even or they may prefer a
verdi requiem even if they know the words they may wear hawaiian shirts they may dress all in black they may even wear orange robes many
buddhists lack a belief in any sort of god some atheists even carry a copy
of the bible around for arguing against of course whoever you are the chances are you have met several atheists without
realising it atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and
appearance unexceptional but aren t atheists less moral than religious people that depends if you define morality as obedience to god then of course
atheists are less moral as they don t obey any god but usually when one
talks of morality one talks of what is acceptable right and unacceptable wrong behaviour within society humans are social animals and to be maximally successful they must
co operate with each other this is a good enough reason to discourage most
atheists from anti social or immoral behaviour purely for the purposes
of self preservation many atheists behave in a moral or compassionate way simply because they
feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans so why do they care
what happens to others they don t know they simply are that way naturally there are some people who behave immorally and try to use
atheism to justify their actions however there are equally many people who
behave immorally and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their
actions for example here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance jesus christ came into the world to save sinners but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me jesus christ might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory forever and ever the above quote is from a statement made to the court on february th by jeffrey dahmer the notorious cannibal serial killer of milwaukee wisconsin it seems that for every atheist mass murderer there is a
religious mass murderer but what of more trivial morality a survey conducted by the roper organization found that behavior deteriorated after born again experiences while only of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being born again had done so after conversion similarly had used illegal drugs before conversion after two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation after freethought today september p so it seems that at best religion does not have a monopoly on moral
behaviour is there such a thing as atheist morality if you mean is there such a thing as morality for atheists then the
answer is yes as explained above many atheists have ideas about morality
which are at least as strong as those held by religious people if you mean does atheism have a characteristic moral code then the answer
is no atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person
will behave most atheists follow many of the same moral rules as theists but for different reasons atheists view morality as something created by
humans according to the way humans feel the world ought to work rather
than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being then aren t atheists just theists who are denying god a study by the freedom from religion foundation found that over of the
atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for
them they had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible
with what they observed around them atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial they are
unbelievers through choice the vast majority of them have spent time
studying one or more religions sometimes in very great depth they have
made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs this decision may of course be an inevitable consequence of that
individual s personality for a naturally sceptical person the choice
of atheism is often the only one that makes sense and hence the only
choice that person can honestly make but don t atheists want to believe in god atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them many
of them have no desire to be watched over no matter how good natured the big brother figure might be some atheists would like to be able to believe in god but so what should
one believe things merely because one wants them to be true the risks of
such an approach should be obvious atheists often decide that wanting to
believe something is not enough there must be evidence for the belief but of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of god they are unwilling in their souls to see many if not most atheists were previously religious as has been explained
above the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that god
exists many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach god of course it is true that some atheists lack an open mind but assuming that
all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed minded comments such as of course god is there you just aren t looking properly are likely to be viewed as patronizing certainly if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is
vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are
being sincere if they say that they have searched for god if you are not
willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth debate is
futile isn t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist many atheists live a purposeful life they decide what they think gives
meaning to life and they pursue those goals they try to make their lives
count not by wishing for eternal life but by having an influence on other
people who will live on for example an atheist may dedicate his life to
political reform in the hope of leaving his mark on history it is a natural human tendency to look for meaning or purpose in random
events however it is by no means obvious that life is the sort of thing
that has a meaning to put it another way not everything which looks like a question is actually
a sensible thing to ask some atheists believe that asking what is the
meaning of life is as silly as asking what is the meaning of a cup of
coffee they believe that life has no purpose or meaning it just is so how do atheists find comfort in time of danger there are many ways of obtaining comfort from family friends or even pets or on a less spiritual level from food or drink or tv that may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger but so
what should individuals believe in things because they are comforting or
should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be in the end it s a decision for the individual concerned most atheists are
unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because
it makes them feel comfortable they put truth before comfort and consider
that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy that s just
hard luck don t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong the short answer is no do you many atheists have been atheists for years they have encountered many
arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of god but they have
found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive thousands of years of religious belief haven t resulted in any good proof of
the existence of god atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely
to be proved wrong in the immediate future and they stop worrying about it so why should theists question their beliefs don t the same arguments apply no because the beliefs being questioned are not similar weak atheism is
the sceptical default position to take it asserts nothing strong atheism
is a negative belief theism is a very strong positive belief atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs
because of the very real harm they can cause not just to the believers but to everyone else what sort of harm religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind it s not
just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings think of all the time and effort spent building churches praying and so on imagine how that effort could be better spent many theists believe in miracle healing there have been plenty of instances
of ill people being healed by a priest ceasing to take the medicines
prescribed to them by doctors and dying as a result some theists have died
because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds it is arguable that the catholic church s opposition to birth control and
condoms in particular is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many
third world countries and contributing to the spread of aids world wide religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than
allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different
religion those weren t real believers they just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse what makes a real believer there are so many one true religions it s hard
to tell look at christianity there are many competing groups all
convinced that they are the only true christians sometimes they even fight
and kill each other how is an atheist supposed to decide who s a real
christian and who isn t when even the major christian churches like the
catholic church and the church of england can t decide amongst themselves in the end most atheists take a pragmatic view and decide that anyone who
calls himself a christian and uses christian belief or dogma to justify his
actions should be considered a christian maybe some of those christians
are just perverting christian teaching for their own ends but surely if
the bible can be so readily used to support un christian acts it can t be
much of a moral code if the bible is the word of god why couldn t he have
made it less easy to misinterpret and how do you know that your beliefs
aren t a perversion of what your god intended if there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the bible then why
should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say so sorry but if someone claims that he believes in jesus and that he murdered
others because jesus and the bible told him to do so we must call him a
christian obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned but since nobody has ever proved that god does not exist it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs shared by all faiths are nonsense that does not hold because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much
harder to disprove than negative ones nobody has ever proved that unicorns
don t exist but that doesn t make it unlikely that they are myths it is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than
it is to hold a positive assertion by default of course weak atheists
would argue that asserting nothing is better still well if atheism s so great why are there so many theists unfortunately the popularity of a belief has little to do with how correct it is or whether it works consider how many people believe in astrology graphology and other pseudo sciences many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in
gods certainly in many primitive human societies religion allows the
people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand of course there s more to religion than that in the industrialized world we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when
there are perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may have started
as a means of attempting to explain the world but nowadays it serves other
purposes as well but so many cultures have developed religions surely that must say something not really most religions are only superficially similar for example it s
worth remembering that religions such as buddhism and taoism lack any sort of
concept of god in the christian sense of course most religions are quick to denounce competing religions so it s
rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another what about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that god exists for every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god there is one who
does not besides as has already been pointed out the truth of a belief is
not determined by how many people believe it also it is important to
realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the
same way that theists view their religious leaders a famous scientist is only human she may be an expert in some fields but
when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight many
respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on
subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise so are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing not entirely it certainly indicates that the religion in question has
properties which have helped it so spread so far the theory of memetics talks of memes sets of ideas which can propagate
themselves between human minds by analogy with genes some atheists view
religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes which spread by
encouraging their hosts to convert others some memes avoid destruction by
discouraging believers from questioning doctrine or by using peer pressure
to keep one time believers from admitting that they were mistaken some
religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by
other memes of course in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with
successful propagation of a meme religion is not a good thing because of
the number of people who believe it any more than a disease is a good thing
because of the number of people who have caught it even if religion is not entirely true at least it puts across important messages what are the fundamental messages of atheism there are many important ideas atheists promote the following are just a
few of them don t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some
religions there is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules be especially sceptical of positive claims if you want your life to have some sort of meaning it s up to you to find it search for what is true even if it makes you uncomfortable make the most of your life as it s probably the only one you ll have it s no good relying on some external power to change you you must change yourself just because something s popular doesn t mean it s good if you must assume something assume something it s easy to test don t believe things just because you want them to be true and finally and most importantly all beliefs should be open to question thanks for taking the time to read this article mathew begin pgp signature iqcvagubk ajrxzxn vroblfaqfsbwp mhepy g ge mo wpsivx khyyxmerfao ltvtmvtu nz sbbpw qkbjarby s sz nf htdii r sseypl r bv oke q

the almost codified way they were in matthew or luke however they are
considered to be similar enough to point to knowledge of q as such and
not an entirely different source we are talking date of texts here not the age of the authors the usual

that of matthew and probably that of mark as it is assumed that john knew the content of luke s text the evidence
for that is not overwhelming admittedly when they are from about why do they shed doubt on the order on
putting john after the rest of the three sure an original together with id card of sender and receiver would be
fine so what s that supposed to say am i missing something that john was a disciple is not generally accepted the style and language
together with the theology are usually used as counterargument the argument that john was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel
of john itself is there any other evidence for it one step and one generation removed is bad even in our times compare that
to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies not even to speak off that believers are not necessarily the best sources in other words one does not know what the original of mark did look like
and arguments based on mark are pretty weak but how is that connected to a redating of john benedikt"

is one of the reasons why i am an atheist believe me i believed similar sentences for a long time but that shows
the power of religion and not anything about its claims it follows from a definition of evil as ordinarily used letting evil
happen or allowing evil to take place in this place even causing evil is another evil the omniscient attribute of god will know what the creatures will do even
before the omnipotent has created them there is no choice left all is known the course of events is fixed not even for the omniscient itself to extend an argument by james tims and when i am not omnipotent how can i have free will you have said
something about choices and the scenario gives them therefore we have
what you define as free will imagine the following i can do good to other beings but i cannot harm them easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good
deeds but don t make them long for them so they can not feel the absence
of good as evil but whose case am i arguing it is conceivable so the omnipotent can do it or it would not be omnipotent if you want logically consistent as well you
have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first deletion that the bible describes an omniscient and omnipotent god destroys

note that that situation will never occur there are always other options
thank killing why don t you just say that all killing is wrong this
is basically what you are saying are you attempting to be condescending but most people have found the risk to be acceptable you are probably
much more likely to die in a plane crash or even using an electric

someone wrongs me i will take great lengths to make sure that his advantage
is removed or a similar situation is forced upon him if someone kills
another then we can apply the golden rule and kill this person in turn is not our entire moral system based on such a concept or are you stating that human life is sacred somehow and that it should
never be violated this would sound like some sort of religious view once a criminal has committed a murder his desires are irrelevant and you still have not answered my question if you are concerned about
the death penalty due to the possibility of the execution of an innocent then why isn t this same concern shared with imprisonment shouldn t we by your logic administer as minimum as punishment as possible to avoid
violating the liberty or happiness of an innocent person keith"

the blame for fatal traffic accidents this is something that is surely

what risk is acceptable it is much more likely that an innocent person
will be killed driving than it is that one will be executed keith"
51134,alt.atheism,i answer from the position that we would indeed place these people in prison for life that depends not only on their predisposition towards murder but also in their success rate at escape and therefore their ability to commit the same crimes again in other words if lifetime imprisonment doesn t work perhaps it s not because we re not executing these people but because we re not being careful enough about how we lock them up bob beauchaine they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea
51135,alt.atheism,damn right you can t provide any evidence for it rarely are any widespread social phenomenon reducible to such a simple premise if they were psychology would be a hard science with roughly the same mathematical soundness as physics your premise may well be right it is much more likely however that it reflects your socialization and religious background as well as your need to validate your religious beliefs were i to pretend to have all the answers and i don t i would say that the xenophobia guilt and intolerance brought about by adherence to fundamentalist religions play just as large a role in depressing the members of our society your mileage obviously varies bob beauchaine they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea
51136,alt.atheism,yes i do my argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to kill people that is it s primary and i would argue only purpose to continue to kill people by a practice that has almost no utility especially when you know you will be killing innocents is unconscionable at the very least the existence of the prison system and our transportation system are based on their merits to society not their detriments we are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems one has to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment just in case i wasn t clear again we maintain a capital punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with no net positive gain why were you to pin me in a corner and ask i would have to respond that i don t belief the state should have the right to take life at all but i won t open that debate as it seems others are tiring of this thread on a a anyway bob beauchaine they said that queens could stay they blew the bronx away and sank manhattan out at sea

51142.eml,alt.atheism,"well i ve said that when an innocent person has been executed this is
objectively a murder however who is at blame is another question it seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions realizing the risks is to blame yes but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing
any raondom activity presumably you had not isolated yourself totally
from the rest of society because of this and i argue that our law system is a similar risk perhaps an innocent
person will be punished someday but we work to prevent this in fact many criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment
of innocents but such accidents are to be totally expected given the numner of vehicals
on the road again the blame is on society yes but the state is not at fault in such a case the state can only do
so much to prevent false witnesses okay so this is what you call murder but the question is whether or not
all such murders are wrong are you saying that all taking of human life
is wrong no matter what the circumstances but this is basically how it works society accepts the risk that an
innocent person will be murdered by execution and every member of
society shares this blame and most people s definitions of murder
include some sort of malicious intent which is not involved in an
execution is it murder violates the golden rule executions do not because by allowing
it at all society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the
innocent victim is reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction
was moral or not but in an objective system only the absolute truth
matters and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth that
is twelve members must be convinced of a truth but then if we read the minds of these people we would know that the
conviction was unfair yes while we could objectively determine the difference if we knew all
possible information we can t always determine the difference in our
flawed system i think that our system is almost as good as possible but it still isn t objectively perfect you see it doesn t matter if
we know it is fair or not objectively it is either fair or it is not but what we know has no effect on an objective system why are you so sure why is your reality important but we can assume that the system is fairly decent at least most likely and you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a
totally ideal and objective system well we can have an ideal system but the working system can not be ideal we can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to
the ideal system as possible yes we all bear the responsibility most people seem willing to do this we must realize the consequences of all our actions why do you keep

51153.eml,alt.atheism,"deleted think deleted let me first say that to believe that no gods exist is in fact different than not believing in a god or gods i will argue that your latter statement i believe that no gods exist does rest upon faith that is if you are making a positive statement that no gods exist strong atheism rather than merely saying i don t know and therefore don t believe in them and don t not believe in then weak atheism once again to not believe in god is different than saying i believe that god does not exist i still maintain the position even after reading the faqs that strong atheism requires faith but first let me say the following we might have a language problem here in regards to faith and existence i as a christian maintain that god does not exist to exist means to have being in space and time god does not have
being god is being kierkegaard once said that god does not
exist he is eternal with this said i feel it s rather pointless
to debate the so called existence of god and that is not what
i m doing here i believe that god is the source and ground of
being when you say that god does not exist i also accept this
statement but we obviously mean two different things by it however in what follows i will use the phrase the existence of god in it s usual sense and this is the sense that i think you are using it i would like a clarification upon what you mean by the existence of
god we also might differ upon what it means to have faith here is what
webster says faith a allegiance to duty or a person loyalty
b fidelity to one s promises sincerity of intentions a belief and trust in and loyalty to god belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion
b firm belief in something for which there is no proof complete trust something that is believed esp with strong conviction esp a system of religious beliefs
syn see belief one can never prove that god does or does not exist when you say
that you believe god does not exist and that this is an opinion based upon observation i will have to ask what observtions are
you refering to there are no observations pro or con that
are valid here in establishing a positive belief all observations
can only point you in a direction a direction that we might even
be predisposed to by predisposed i mean for example people whoes partents believe in god also tend to to actually draw a conclusion
about the existence or non existence of god requires a leap and
you have made this leap when you actively say i believe that god does does not exist personally i think that both statements are
misguided arguing over the existence of god is precisely the wrong way
to find him and yes i use him because a personal god is the only viable concept imo if a person wants to use she go ahead of course god is neither he nor she but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise if you want me to explain myself further i ll be glad to and please if someone does not agree with me even if they violently disagree it s in no ones advantage to start name calling if a person thinks i ve misunderstood something in the faqs or if they they think i have not read them well enough just point out to me the error of my ways and i correct the situation i m interested in a polite and well thought out discussion"

proving liberty is never free it is always purchased at some cost almost always at the cost to another whos liberty is more inalienable similarly for right of life when one person must die if he is to save
another or even a group of others whos life is more inalienable that leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty especially for serial killers whos life and liberty is more valuable the serial killer or the victim according to that beautiful line those two rights should be completely inviolate that is noone should be

blanks and someone was killed with such a gun the person who actually
performed the action isn t the murderer but i guess this is actually made
clear in the below definition what do you mean by reasonable yes it is bad to include the word being defined in the definition but even though the series is recursively infinite i think the meaning can
still be deduced math lesson deleted okay let s look at this situation suppose there is a longstanding
feud between two families which claim that the other committed some
travesty in the distant past each time a member of the one family
kills a member of the other the other family thinks that it is justified
in killing a that member of the first family now let s suppose that this
sequence has occurred an infinite number of times or if you don t
like dealing with infinities suppose that one member of the family
goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing that is there
is a never ending loop of slayings based on some non existent travesty how do you resolve this well they are all murders now i suppose that this isn t totally applicable to your problem but
it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system and in any case the nested murderer in the definition of murder
cannot be infintely recursive given the finite existence of humanity and a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved so the
first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily
a murderer is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently
unreducable definition see in a totally objective system where all the

51175,alt.atheism,"what do you mean by omnipotent here do you mean by omnipotent that god should be able to do anything everything this creates
a self contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively
useless to be descriptive omnipotence must mean being all powerful and
not being able to do anything everything let me illustrate by analogy suppose the united states were the only nuclear power on earth suppose
further that the us military could not effectively be countered by any
nation or group of nations the us has the power to go into any country
at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the
us see fit the us would be militarily omnipotent but suppose further that the us holds to a doctrine philosophy of not
interfering in the internal affairs of any nation such as the current
civil war in the former yugoslavian states technically in this scenario the us would have the power to unilaterally go into yugoslavia and straighten out the mess but
effectively the us could not intervene without violating its own policy of non interference if the policy of non interference were held to
strongly enough then there would never be a question that it would
ever be violated effectively the us would be limited in what it
could actually do although it had the power to do whatever it wanted the us would simply never want to interfere for such an idea would
be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate
non interference policy god is effectively limited in the same sense he is all powerful but
he cannot use his power in a way that would violate the essence of what
he himself is i hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning

51208.eml,alt.atheism,"why do babies get diseases etc here s the main problem the scenario you outline is reasonably consistent but all the evidence that i am familiar with not only does
not support it but indicates something far different the earth by
latest estimates is about billion years old and has had life for
about billion of those years humans have only been around for at
most about years but the fossil evidence inidcates that life
has been changing and evolving and in fact disease ridden long before
there were people yes there are fossils that show signs of disease mostly bone disorders of course but there are some heck not just
fossil evidence but what we ve been able to glean from genetic study shows
that disease has been around for a long long time if human sin was what
brought about disease at least indirectly though necessarily then
how could it exist before humans deletions uh i know of many evolutionary biologists who know more about
biology than you claim to who will strongly disagree with this there
is no evidence that the human genetic code or any other started off in perfect condition it seems to adapt to its envionment in a
collective sense i m really curious as to what you mean by the
degeneration of the genetic code umm nah we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and
bacteria and they to us only a very small percentage of microlife is
harmful to humans and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby
constant in size but the ranks keep changing for example bubonic
plague used to be a really nasty disease i m sure you ll agree but
it still pops up from time to time even today and doesn t do as
much damage part of that is because of better sanitation but even
when people get the disease the symptoms tend to be less severe than in
the past this seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible
died off long ago and because the really nasty variants overgrazed forgive the poor terminology i m an engineer not a doctor and
died off for lack of nearby hosts i could be wrong on this but from what i gather acne is only a few
hundred years old and used to be nastier though no killer it seems to
be getting less nasty w age now wait a minute i have a question humans were created perfect right and you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease it
seems unlikely that satan who s making the diseases would also gift
humans with the means to fight them off simpler to make the diseases less
lethal if he wants survivors as far as i can see our immune systems imperfect though they may presently be must have been built into us
by god i want to be clear on this are you saying that god was planning
ahead for the time when satan would be in charge by building an immune
system that was not at the time of design necessary that is god made
our immune systems ahead of time knowing that adam and eve would sin and
their descendents would need to fight off diseases here s another puzzle what exactly do you mean by perfect in the
phrase created perfect and without flaw to my mind a perfect system would be incapable of degrading over time a perfect system
that will without constant intervention become imperfect is not a
perfect system at least imho or is it that god did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a
bunch of gum wrappers held together with elmer s glue that is the
original genetic instructions were perfect but were written in
inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart if so why could god not have used better materials was god incapable of creating a system that could maintain itself of did it just choose not to deletions my main point as i said was that there really isn t any evidence for

51211.eml,alt.atheism,"this kind of argument cries for a comment god did not create disease nor is he responsible for the maladies of newborns what god did create was life according to a protein code which is mutable and can evolve without delving into a deep discussion of creationism vs evolutionism god created the original genetic code perfect and without flaw do you have any evidence for this if the code was once perfect and
has degraded ever since we should have some evidence in favour
of this statement shouldn t we perhaps the biggest imperfection of the code is that it is full
of non coding regions introns which are so called because they
intervene with the coding regions exons an impressive amount of
evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin it is
likely that early exons represented early protein domains is the number of introns decreasing or increasing it appears that
intron loss can occur and species with common ancestry usually
have quite similar exon intron structure in their genes on the other hand the possibility that introns have been inserted
later presents several logical difficulties introns are removed
by a splicing mechanism this would have to be present but unused if introns are inserted moreover intron insertion would have
required precise targeting random insertion would not be tolerated since sequences for intron removal self splicing of mrna are
conserved besides transposition of a sequence usually leaves a
trace long terminal repeats and target site duplications and
these are not found in or near intron sequences i seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and
genetics before posting theological arguments like this try watson s molecular biology of the gene or darnell lodish baltimore s molecular biology of the cell for starters remember the question was posed in a theological context why does god cause disease in newborns and my answer is likewise from a theological perspective my own it is no less valid than a purely scientific perspective just different scientific perspective is supported by the evidence whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion i think you misread my meaning i said god made the genetic code perfect but that doesn t mean it s perfect now it has certainly evolved since for the worse would you please cite a few references that support
your assertion your assertion is less valid than the scientific
perspective unless you support it by some evidence in fact it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps
more important than we ve thought for instance sex might
have evolved as defence against parasites this view is supported by
computer simulations of evolution eg tierra perhaps i thought it was higher energy rays like x rays gamma rays and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage in fact it is thermal energy that does most of the damage although
it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action actually neither of us knows what the atmosphere was like at the time when god created life according to my recollection most biologists do not claim that life began billion years ago after all that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth was created it would still be too primitive to support life i seem to remember a figure more like to billion years ago for the origination of life on earth anyone with a better estimate i d replace created with formed since there is no need to invoke any creator if the earth can be formed without one most recent estimates of the age of the earth range between billion years and earliest signs of life not true fossils but
organic stromatolite like layers date back to billion years this would leave more than billion years for the first cells to
evolve i m sorry i can t give any references this is based on the course
on evolutionary biochemistry i attended here dominion it was no great feat for satan to genetically engineer diseases both bacterial viral and genetic although the forces of natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species the degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this again do you want this be true or do you have any evidence for
this supposed degeneration i can understand scott s reaction excuse me but this is so far fetched that i know you must be jesting do you know what pathogens are do you know what point mutations are do you know that everything can come about spontaneously in response to your last statement no and neither do you you may very well believe that and accept it as fact but you cannot know that i hope you don t forget this we have evidence that suggests everything can come about spontaneously do you have evidence against
this conclusion in science one does not have to believe in anything it is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve but the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so and not to present one s own conclusions prior to this theology does not use this method therefore i seriously doubt
it could ever come to right conclusions human dna being more complex tends to accumulate errors adversely affecting our well being and ability to fight off disease while the simpler dna of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in causing infection and disease it is a bad combination hence we have newborns that suffer from genetic viral and bacterial diseases disorders you are supposing a purpose not a valid move bacteria and viruses
do not exist to cause disease they are just another manifests of
a general principle of evolution only replication saves replicators
from degradiation we are just an efficient method for our dna to survive and replicate the less efficient methods didn t make it to the present and for the last time please present some evidence for your claim that
human dna is degrading through evolutionary processes some people have
claimed that the opposite is true we have suppressed our selection and thus are bound to degrade i haven t seen much evidence for either
claim but then i ask so where is this relevant to my discussion in answering john s question of why why are there genetic diseases and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require babies to develop antibodies is it god s fault the original question i say no it is not of course nothing evil is god s fault but your explanation does
not work it fails miserably you may be right but the fact is that you don t know that satan is not responsible and neither do i suppose that a powerful evil being like satan exists would it be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills that affect mankind i don t think so he could have done a much better job pun intended the problem is it seems no satan is necessary to explain any diseases they are
just as inevitable as any product of evolution did i say that where seems to me like another bad inference actually what you ve done is to oversimplify what i said to the point that your summary of my words takes on a new context i never said that people are meant presumably by god to be punished by getting diseases why i did say is that free moral choices have attendent consequences if mankind chooses to reject god as people have done since the beginning then they should not expect god to protect them from adverse events in an entropic universe i am not expecting this if god exists i expect him to leave us alone i would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed
free this is an interesting philosophical question and the answer
is not as clear cut as it seems to be what consequences would you expect from rejecting allah oh i admit it s not perfect yet but i m working on it a good library or a bookstore is a good starting point what does this have to do with the price of tea in china or the question to which i provided an answer biology and genetics are fine subjects and important scientific endeavors but they explain how god created and set up life processes they don t explain the why behind creation life or its subsequent evolution why is there a why behind and your proposition was something
that is not supported by the evidence this is why we recommend
these books is there any need to invoke any why behind a prime mover evidence
for this if the whole universe can come into existence without
any intervention as recent cosmological theories hawking et al suggest why do people still insist on this thanks scotty for your fine and sagely advice but i am not highly motivated to learn all the nitty gritty details of biology and genetics although i m sure i d find it a fascinating subject for i realize that the details do not change the big picture that god created life in the beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its environment i m sorry but they do there is no evidence for your big picture and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation it can come into existence without a supreme being try reading p w atkins creation revisited freeman petri"

epistemological consideration what do we accept as a reliable way of
knowing there are no known valid logical arguments for the existence
of gods nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that
must be accepted on faith faith is belief without a sound logical
basis or empirical evidence it is a reliable way of knowing there is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence
of any possibility of proof even when we agree to take someone elses
word on faith we just mean that having found this person to be
reliable in the past we judge him likely to be a reliable source now if we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence
everywhere else why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about
gods the difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then
one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing rather than as some agnostic posters would have it whether ones faith
is in gods or no gods the theist believes that faith is an acceptable
basis for a belief in gods even if he rejects faith as reliable at
other times for example in his work as a scientist the atheist
believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable
knowledge agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than
theism or atheism unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other
knowledge without evidence why should we believe in gods rather than
santa claus or the easter bunny i would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn t
require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods i don t believe that
there is any such thing as absolute knowledge atheism is the best and

somehow costs us all a lot of money this is just not correct that is to say the religion of this country and the non religion of

all atheists in general as well i don t think that any of the quotes although i seem to have lost them mentioned anything at all about jesus they advocated religion over non religion a specific religion was not
mentioned so you are saying that all christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed just because they think they are wrong that s silly i think the flat earthers are wrong but i don t advocate their banishment i think that any such cost would be insignificant i mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency well mottos in general don t really have purposes i don t think it
should be removed because i think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences then you should be concerned with the opinion of the entire congress why not it is the majority that put it there but do they remember the debate surrounding the motto do they remember
that some people intended it to be a message against atheists why don t
you include this in your little survey that you were conducting what should i ask some scientists the probability that something einstein
said about relativity is worthy i mean if einstein said it there s a
good chance that it was right at least at the time you need not agree with them all of the time but you would certainly think

that as benedikt pointed out lucifer had perfect nature yet he

as being an after the fact rationalisation and in fact like
salvation not one that all christians believe in identically at least in my mind salvation and free will are very tightly

strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism i wish whereas i logically can only support the weak atheist position in effect i am
a strong atheist and wish i could be a mathematical one to

the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny
is faulty if i read the faq correctly no argument for the existence of god generic as represented by mainstream theologians has ever been

to stick to the one thing i don t quite follow about the argument it seems to me that there is a contradiction in arguing that the bible
was enlightened for its times i e closer to what we would consider
morally good based on our standards and past experience on the one
hand i hope this summarizes this argument adequately and on the
other hand disclaimer i m speaking from the jewish perspective where the bible means what many call the old testament and where the interpretation is not necessarily the raw text but instead the court cases commentaries and traditions passed down through jewish communities this seems the crux to me if you judge the bible according to a long line of traditions and interpretations coming down to the current day rather than on its own merits as a cultural artifact then of course it will correspond more closely with more contemporary values but if that s how the bible is actually being used today shouldn t that be how we should judge it if most people use scissors to cut paper shouldn t consumer s reports test scissors for paper cutting ability even though scissors may have been designed originally to cut cloth that s possibly a good way to judge the use of the bible in teaching
jewish morality today but it hardly seems fair to claim that this
highly interpreted version is what was enlightened for its times to attempt to extend the analogy this is like saying that the
original scissor makers were unusually advanced at paper cutting for
their times even though they only ever cut cloth and had never even
heard of paper i m not arguing that the bible is disgusting though some of the
history depicted in it is by modern standards however history is
full of similar abuses and i don t think the biblical accounts are
worse than their contemporaries or possibly ours on the other hand i don t know of any reason to think the history described in the bible
shows less abuse than their contemporaries or ours that complex
and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic
interpretations of that history is interesting but i still don t
think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it

it or it is purely arbitrary further the question is why is has
one to carry the burden of biblical texts when one could simply write
other books that convey the message better you might answer that one
can t becuase some peculiar biblical information might be lost but

51268.eml,alt.atheism,"well i could use the argument that some here use about nature and claim
that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human superhuman
powers are beyond what a human has and since you are a human any powers
you have are not beyond those of a human hence you cannot have superhuman
powers sound good to you anyway to the evidence question it depends on the context in this group since you are posting from a american college site i m willing to take it
as given that you have a pair of blue jeans and assuming there is some
coherency in your position i will take it as a given that you do not have
superhuman powers arguments are evidence in themselves in some respects yep good extra evidence why don t we start with evidence at all i cannot see any evidence for the v b which the cynics in this group would
ever accept as for the second it is the foundation of the religion anyone who claims to have seen the risen jesus back in the day period is a believer and therefore is discounted by those in this group since
these are all ancients anyway one again to choose to dismiss the whole
thing the third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it means so
again i don t see how evidence is possible i thus interpret the extraordinary claims claim as a statement that the
speaker will not accept any evidence on the matter"

similar viewpoints on the core theological issues the jws do not fall

rejected by all the nicene churches and virtually everyone else as well"

really leads to any firm conclusion the material in john i m not sure

to the matt luke q material is different hence one could have almost
any relationship between the two right up to john getting it straight from
jesus mouth the version of the usual theory i have heard has matthew and luke
independently relying on mark and q one would think that if luke relied
on matthew we wouldn t have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies for one thing this is the part that is particularly new to me if it were possible that
you could point me to a reference i d be grateful because it closes up the gap between supposed writing and the existing
copy quit a bit the further away from the original the more copies can be
written and therefore survival becomes more probable i m not really impressed with the theology argument but i m really
pointing this out as an if and as i pointed out earlier one cannot make
these arguments about i peter i see no reason not to accept it as an
authentic letter the best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants which is
not so bad but the statement of divinity is not in that section and in any case it s
agreed that the most important epistles predate mark"
51271.eml,alt.atheism,"if you re talking about this intellectual engagement of revelation well it s obviously a risk one takes i m not an objectivist so i m not particularly impressed with problems of
conceptualization the problem in this case is at least as bad as that of
trying to explain quantum mechanics and relativity in the terms of ordinary
experience one can get some rough understanding but the language is from
the perspective of ordinary phenomena inconsistent and from the
perspective of what s being described rather inexact to be charitable an analogous situation supposedly obtains in metaphysics the problem is
that the better descriptive language is not available this word reliable is essentially meaningless in the context unless you
can show how reliability can be determined"

for your claim the usual line here which you call a prejudgment of
atheism and dispute is that reason is all we have here you admit
that you have no alternative no possible basis for the claim that
there is anything other than reason or that reason is inapplicable in
religious knowledge except possibly that reason conflicts with religious knowledge this sounds very much like i can t provide a rational defense for my

with humans said revelation taking the form paraphrased from your
own words this infinitely powerful deity grabs some poor schmuck makes him take dictation and then hides away for a few hundred years now there exists a human who has not personally experienced a
revelation this person observes that not only do these revelations seem
to contain elements that contradict rather strongly aspects of the
observed world which is all this person has ever seen but there are
many mutually contradictory claims of revelation now based on this can this person be blamed for concluding absent
a personal revelation of their own that there is almost certainly
nothing to this revelation thing absent this better language and absent observations in support of the
claims of revelation can one be blamed for doubting the whole thing here is what i am driving at i have thought a long time about this i
have come to the honest conclusion that if there is a deity it is
nothing like the ones proposed by any religion that i am familiar with now if there does happen to be say a christian god will i be held

contrast the quality of the images was pretty good there were no
visible contrast bands to minimize the exposure time the display program built different bit frames the first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value the second only for pixels that had value etc these frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to or onto the screen in sequence creating these
frames sometimes took minutes on that old mac but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway and yes we wrote
directly to the screen memory mea culpa our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the

coefficients use a non separated direct multiply accumulate d idct sounds great doesn t it which turned out to be faster than a fast algorithm in this quite common case dithering is pretty standard main
difference to the berkeley decoder except for the fewer number of supported
algorithms is the use of instead of colors the default option to
use a restricted color space and the implementation of a color saturation
dominant ordered dither this leads to a significantly superior quality of
the dithered image i claim judge yourself restricted color space means that the u and v components are clipped to instead of and the display color space points are distributed
over this restricted space since the distance between color space points
is thus reduced by a factor of two the color resolution is doubled at the
expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color lying
somewhere between the points of the display color space is approximated
by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
constant saturation this yields subjectivly better quality due to the
lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
to hue changes the same reasoning as used by the pal tv standard to improve
on ntsc the improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
areas"

information posted some years ago on this very problem note the early use of
postscript technology predating many of this year s papers listed in the
april st siggraph program announcement posted here a few days ago eric intersection between a line and a polygon undecidable by dave baraff tom duff i think that this is a very difficult problem to start with lines and
polygons are semi algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points here are a few off the cuff ideas first we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated now the
jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open and thus non compact regions thus the line lies
completely inside the polygon the line lies completely outside the polygon or possibly but this will rarely happen the line intersects the polyon now the phrasing of this question says if a line intersects a polygon so
this is a decision problem one possibility the decision model approach is
to reduce the question to some other well known problem q and then try to
solve q an answer to q gives an answer to the original decision problem in recent years many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called postscript see postscript language by adobe systems
incorporated isbn co so given a line l and a polygon p we can write a postscript program that
draws the line l and the polygon p and then outputs the answer by output we mean the program executes a command called showpage which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon a quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem q and thus
the original problem there are two small problems with this approach there is an infinite number of ways to encode l and p into the reduced problem q so we will be forced to invoke the axiom of choice or equivalently zorn s lemma but the use of the axiom of choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days more importantly the question arises as to whether or not the postscript program q will actually output a piece of paper or in other words will it halt now postscript is expressive enough to encode everything that a turing machine might do thus the halting problem for postscript is undecidable it is quite possible that the original problem will turn out to be undecidable i won t even begin to go into other difficulties such as aliasing finite

may make you headache the second method is pi algorithm draw the lines between the point and
all the vertices on the polygon calculate and sum the angles of the

can help a little unfortunately while sgi systems were used to create the special effects
for both terminator and lawnmower man those are film quality computer
graphics rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time each
frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
high end parallel processing computer systems thus that level of graphics
would be difficult if not impossible to acheive in real time frames
per second it depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is true immersive visualization vr requires the rendering of complex visual
databases at anywhere from to newly rendered frames per second this
is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of
the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion
of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous thus the graphics system
must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
data representations additionally the frame rate must be constant if the system renders frames per second at one point then frames per second the next perhaps
due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the
graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant
frame rate the system must be able to run in real time unix in general
does not support real time operation but silicon graphics has modified the
unix kernel for its multi processor systems to be able to support real time
operation bypassing the usual unix process priority management schemes uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real time
operation not sun sparc not hp series systems not ibm rs not
even sgi s uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our
multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real time operation due
to their symmetric multi processing smp shared memory architecture from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments
requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real time
multi sample anti aliasing of all of the general purpose graphics systems
on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine systems fully support these capabilities the anti aliasing is particularly
important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment you can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop

comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors
that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck i m also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a
previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around
for a while rather than being flushed now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to
keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself
pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
just before the end of the quarter but i m just a little tired of
getting boned in the process maybe it s because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we
aren t entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs

addition to the usual video signal inputs and claimed to print gray

format the parallel data to print and bit pixel images after some initial
problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an hewlett packard workstation and i can print and bit pixel images just fine i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs this was not mentioned in the sales literature however they
did say the p u can do bit pixel level images in parallel mode but
they didn t have any information about how to program it to do so and they
would call japan etc frankly i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do bit pixel images
from the video source it can t store bits pixel in the memory it s not
like memory is that expensive any more if anybody has any information on
getting bit pixel or even bit pixel images out of this thing i would

38304.eml,comp.graphics,"opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable
interface for the development of interactive d graphics applications it
is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly
from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to high
performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl
means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no
guarantee that your performance would be comparable if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a
valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi
sales management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we
understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a
shot as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in and grew to include the d d d and d as clock rates
sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about years this was true of the motorola based series the pi the professional series the early d s the power
series parallel systems individual cpu subsystems running at a
particular clock rate usually live for about years new graphics
architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every months to years these are the facts of life if we look at these machines they become
almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new
platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and i o and larger disk capacities if we
don t we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your
current needs and makes economic sense today you can t wait to buy but
if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep
for one in writing if it s feasible they should be able to do that some
of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as
the performance protection program for older r based power series
multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain
a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge
r based bit multiprocessor systems if that s happening it s becausing of misunderstandings or
mis communication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our
customer base most sgi customers are onesy twosey types but regardless we rarely give a
great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because
again like a previous post stated if we pre announced and the schedule
slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were
counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and
would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial
analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our
commitments five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor
technologies are arriving every years making a year old computer at
least and probably generations behind the times the competitive nature
of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is
really years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability
of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live
with but keeping customers happy is the most important so don t give up we know it josh"

software the quick answer is yes the long answer is yes but a

the same you know as far as many bugs go it would probably be more
useful to everyone including you if you were a bit more explicit platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are rs dec ultrix
sun solaris so it is possible the main problem is that i don t have access to other platforms than the
rs so if there are portability problems then the only way i hear

how to fix it as far as the software not doing anything do you really think i would

10034.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"hello again about a week and one half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings
on the inkjet family of printers specifically a comparison between the
canon bj bubblejet and the hewlett packard deskjet many people
asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and e mail i
received below is my original query and the responses i received i have
not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so
you can extract what you find necessary some people asked me for an
unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests
favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you
believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer there are a
wide range of comments each has its own value there was no clear winner some like the bj especially its
price performance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability
of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid
background two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new
printer to be introduced by hewlett packard later this year around
summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first
inkjet you will find that after the initial purchase the costs of
re filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely
depends on where you purchase the re fills or replacements so shop
around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your
printer no one mentioned approx how many sheets each ink cartridge will
print but i suspect they are roughly equal at about sheets laser printers will do sheets per toner cartridge well that s a brief research summary of my personal research enjoy well i bought the bj about a month ago at the start of their rebate
program on that printer it ends and i bought it from computer
discount warehouse because their price of couldn t be beat anywhere i
looked and i think it s a hot printer just using regular copier paper
produced fantastic results just in high quality mode i compared the
output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with pt type done on my
bj with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed
how well i could read the small print on the bj printing speed was
several seconds faster on the bj which is amazing considering that the
hp has m ram installed i measured the time from when the printer first
indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one
immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders
too if you need cdw s phone number it s delivery to ny
was two days good luck craig witkowski motorola communications electronics inc glen rock nj i own a deskjet performance isn t spectacular under windows using
truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen quality for
the hp is very much dependent on paper quality on standard photo copy
paper the characters have slightly frayed edges but on better quality distinction type paper things look better for most applications i find
copy paper fine still better than dot matrix comes with a windows
driver which seems to by pass print manager has a few intelli fonts which are hp scaleable fonts probably faster than truetype
but haven t really tried them out can get ram font cartridges but unless
the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldn t bother the ram cartridges
can t be used as buffer soft fonts only for graphics i e bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via
the hp supplied win driver there a number of dither options such as scatter pattern etc the manual gives recommendations depending on
the type of image being printed text is not so good in this mode problem
arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text the
range of tones for graphic images isn t brilliant but i think that is more
of a limitation with inkjet printers in general however a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from
epson this printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing
laser like quality on normal copier paper can t remember the model lx something i think i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here the
introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand about a month ago i got a canon bj i absolutely love it it is
incredibly fast except for printing from pspice i don t know if you ever
do stuff with that or not most of the stuff i print is either from
microsoft word for windows or just plain text the only problems i ve had
are printing headers footers the printer freaked out and printing on
cheap paper lots of streaks normal copy paper works great with it you
can only tell it s not laser printed by holding it oh less than twelve
inches from your face that is if you re nearsighted like me the
printer comes with its own driver for windows i have no other
complaints the printer also can act just like some epson or another for
those archaic software packages that haven t written a driver for it yet the teeny weeny footprint is a real plus too and if you purchase it
between now and may you get a rebate from canon i bought mine
from a store called compusa and the price now is i have a friend
who has the hp you are looking at it also prints very well and everyone
has drivers for it but it is very slow hope i helped dpi sure looks great heather stehman i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj at work and a
deskjet at home i prefer the deskjet the printing speed and quality
are similar i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet
for home the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support
in so many applications the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm
proprinter to get it to work with many non windows apps and this will be
the case for a long time the design is superior if you just want to use
cut paper the deskjet is quieter and the ink cartridges are quite a bit
cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs just my worth"

10074.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows
from a novell administrator s point of view i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they microsoft has decided to implement as a standard for software support the local setup described below as the most advantageous installation if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation
then i will comply but i d like to hear it from administrators first the local windows installation windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive assuming the
resources are available from a network administrator s implementation he she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup a then install windows on a per machine bases by running setup off the network
to install the complete system on the local drives in this way all drivers
are available to the setup procedure w o the need to change disks advantages reduce traffic running windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main windows files network independence if the network fails and they all do at one point or another the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down time faster windows theoretically windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network this may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups monochrome color types of mouse etc since the windows installation is assigned to the workstation disadvantages cost installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from to percent administration local windows installations are very difficult to
administer new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation security users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance this could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations backup we all know the problems backing up local hard disks the backup sets if done via a centralized tape system get very large very quickly backup individually to floppy may not happen at all this may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and not user data the shared windows installation windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup a procedure
described above users or administrators then install a minimal set of
files to individual user directories these directories may be on a
local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory the bulk of the
windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory some files and are accessed shared as needed by users throughout
their windows session the user s files consist of a small set of files
that the user has updated during his her windows session these include
group files ini files and other regularly updated files advantages a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy as an updated driver becomes available it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it assuming that the users files are maintained in network home directories the administrator can easily edit any ini file as needed to correct problems that may arise this includes win ini and system ini backup of all pertinent files is done easily even if the users files are on a local hard disk the bulk of the windows system is backed up with all driver updates disadvantages network traffic since all windows files are being shared in a network directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of windows if the network crashes all production comes to a stop since window s is reliant upon the network for its files loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work although minimal disk space is still a consideration if the users files are maintained on the network a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows files alone users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar this is due to the windows installation being tied to a particular username in the case of network user files the discussion i would like to know from other administrators with a large windows
userbase how they prefer setting up windows personally i have
setup numerous installations using the shared setup all windows and
application files are on the network with little or no utilization of
local hard disks in fact i sold a network on the fact that the
company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations
and thus save that much more money i would also like to see recommendations for applications should
apps such as word and or excel be installed locally regardless of how
windows is installed again i keep all files on the network for easy
backup and administration but this is putting all eggs in one basket if the network crashes work comes to a halt now i am sure microsoft and i know your out there has their own
ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to
hear from people with actual working experience with users and network
administration"

seeing any answers so here it is again does any one know of an ftp site where the wd c driver might reside i ve checked cica and i m sure it s not there i m refering to the new

10132.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"if you are planning on using this on a regular basis conncting the printer
to file can become bothersome because windows then asks you for the filename
that you want to create i ve found that putting a line in system ini in the

if you send more than one job the second one deletes the first chris"

the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up even if their
customers must buy new releases from them that are little more than
bug fixes anyone who buys a computer system and then runs ms
windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy oh wait ms innovated the plastic housing on the ms mouse didn t
they logitech inside you can t even really call it secondary creativity when a company
gathers together a bunch of knock off packages and peddles them to
neophytes if ms does anything it appears someone has to do it
first it appears that ms is finding out that throwing money at
technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution"
10135.eml,comp.os.ms-windows.misc,"i ve been using windows nt tm since the october release and i have to say that the march release is really a big improvement windows nt tm is becomming usable there are a few things to consider before you make the leap though first for me at least is that you cannot get a full speed dos box what i mean is i cannot for instance run falcon or any other
resourse intensive program in a dos box it absolutley crawls and my machine is a with a mb hd and mb ram if anyone
knows how to get a fast dos box or full screen for that matter please let me know the second thing is there are still not many drivers around for stuff for instance my pas has been demoted to running as a sound blaster which is natively supported nice because mediavision hasn t produced drivers yet your disk should be large enough to keep an mb dos partition and
give the rest over to windows nt tm the only thing is whenever
you wanted to run windows programs you d have to reboot and log into
windows nt tm instead of just typing win windows nt tm does seem to be much more stable than normal windows
though it d be a good choice if you have the resources you should
really have at least mb ram though one last thing modems work
well enough but i have yet to get my fax card to work and i ve never
heard of anyone else who did either it s only better than unix because it runs killer software out of the
box whereas with unix there isn t the same availablity i guess it comes down to windows nt tm is not yet for the faint
of heart it s still a beta but it s a very good beta"

bus transactions between the two busses most isa boards require
multiple clocks per bus transaction typically this is around eisa boards are suppose to be able to burst at a rate so i
would expect performance to be x x that of an isa card so i guess for me the question is unanswered still i would expect
him to be able to see a x speed difference and he apparently does
not"

configure my machine at home to use a postscript printer and use
the print to file option which produces a nice postscript file which i then bring to work my question how do i print this postscript file through the print
manager at work if for example i select print from the file
manager it treats the postscript as a text file and gives me
several pages of postscript gibberish i know that i can open a dos window and do copy file ps com which does work but seems not to multitask very well other applications
run rather slowly and often pause for s of seconds there ought to be a way of passing the postscript file to the print
manager but if there is i can t find any mention of it in the
documentation anyone know how to do this"

personal politics are more important than smcap bold font god pt the law smcap bold font but that s irrelevant to the problem here windows came with my
system but on disks i hate using disks so i copied
them over to high density s using xcopy it worked fine in
fact for a while i was changing configurations and whatnot so much
that i decided to try putting them on the hard disk not only can you
copy them over with one disk per directory but if you want to you
can simply copy them all into one directory makes it a lot nicer
when you re switching printer emulations around norton i don t have much experience with but when a friend s
system crashed we restored from a backup rather than from the
originals and it worked fine this would imply that arj a r norton

was very impressed with the quantity and quality of the gateway documentation all software came with the original disks and manuals the gateway manual itself is in a nice ring binder the ati gup came
with build drivers all other software i specified microsoft office was properly installed the machine came right up out of the box and has been performing flawlessly it s been on all weekend and it hardly
even reaches room temperature i think the big roomy tower case has a lot to do with it it s up and running dos with no problems i ve also read about
some people having problems with high speed serial communications i used the dos interlink program which lets me link to my old
computer via a serial port at k baud it then maps the other
machines two hard disks as my disks f g you can cd to these
drives and either run programs or copy files it s almost like a
peer peer lan except you can also run programs on the other machine it s not a two way street the other machine is the server and this
machine is the client so thats where it seems to differ from the peer to peer stuff for a bundled dos utility its very impressive my jumbo took about minutes to back up mb of data i also
by passed any potential gateway monitor problems by taking the credit and applying it towards a nec fg i love this monitor so i m glad there is some good news gateway stories and i m glad it

provide some unsolicited advice the most amusing kind of advice today tueday ibm is supposed to officially announce the introduction
of the vesa local bus value point systems these systems still have on board
video and disk which are far better than the prior value point systems and
you get vesa local bus for future upgrades we are going to buy three of
them with monitors also a newly available and one of the three will
immediately be upgraded to ultrastor f caching scsi disk controller and
either the ati gup or the viper graphics board do not buy a sx sytem my personal philosophy on upgrade policy is that it is not loss free when
you earn money you pay taxes when you spend money you pay taxes i e they
get you coming and going translated this means take infrequent but large
steps you are far better off short term and long term if you avoid the sx
models and go straight to the dx or dx models gordon"

slower rate or you reduce the wait states and take the chance that the

59001.eml,comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,"does it do it to all tapes were the two tapes that it unwound of the same
type from the same batch the reason i ask is that i bought some generic tapes
that did this and found that the tape markers were not fully punched out and
had closed the little marker hole it was only on a few tapes of a set did you open up the tape cartridge and put the tape back on the reels if you have not yet open it up by removing the two screws on the bottom of
the tape cartridge and snap the plastic shell away from the metal base as you are pulling the tape through the assembly try not to touch any more than you have to as you are doing it look for a couple of little holes in the tape these are the marker holes which let the tape drive know when it is at the end of the tape the holes are spaced a couple of inches apart my best
guess is that the drive finds the first marker and then stops on the second
marker anyhow if the tape has the holes then check to see if the mirror on the tape
is clean the function of the mirror is to detect the marker holes the
tape drive shines a light at the mirror and has a pickup in the area where
the reflection would come out when the hole goes by the pickup detects the light that was allowed to pass and it knows when to stop if the mirror is dirty
or out of alighment unlikely since it is made into the case you might have
a problem detecting the end of the tape if the tape drive does it on all tapes and the tapes all look good then either
the pickup or the led of the sensor system has failed or is dirty if you open
the drive door you will see the sensor assembly to the left of the r w head
assembly if it looks clean and nothing is in its way then the drive may
need to be serviced it is possible that the led is burned out or the sensor
is out if it is still in warranty you might be able to send it back to cms for

gcc read comp os os programmer for details has spurred a continuing deluge of software ported from unix platforms such as emacs less awk grep sed xscheme ispell flex yacc and much more borland has released its c c compiler for os x allowing for easier porting of dos and windows software much of the pc hardware and drivers were written for dos and later windows as more people are discovering os x the number of people asking questions about os s compatibility with their hardware increases as does the questions on the availability of drivers for their hardware installation procedures etc multimedia is becoming popular os supports windows multimedia extensions using win os furthermore ibm is including direct multimedia support in os starting with version in addition to using win os any

platforms such as dos windows unix etc toolkits which aid in program portability including porting tools such as mirrors and so forth b rename comp os os programmer misc unmoderated to keep the structure of the os newsgroup heirarchy orthogonal comp os os programmer should be renamed to comp os os programmer misc comp os os programmer misc will still be the newsgroup for os programmers to discuss programming issues and technical aspects of os in an unmoderated setting c create comp os os setup unmoderated it will be devoted to os system setup topics including the availability of device

them so i guess i should be glad they didn t just say buy the memory
from us or something like that the one thing that i was puzzled by was why there was not a x x k color mode on the thing either in full screen or
enlarged desktop mode my ati ultra plus can handle that given mb
of memory all the mb buys you on the fahrenheit is x x just one more mode geez had i known i wouldn t have bothered i
asked them why and all i got was your point is well taken but
orchid s software developers are busy with other projects so to get to the point finally are there any s c drivers out there that can handle high res hicolor modes i d love to
get another card but perhaps it will have to wait until the next
generation of cards comes out since this card came bundled with my

broken if you want these modes steer away from orchids s c cards ie vlb or va vlb at least until their developers are less

intermittent freezes then corrupted files and resources then silverlining wouldn t even recognize the drive so i got an rma from la cie and
exchanged the new drive for a reconditioned one well about a month has passed now and the second drive is having problems often when i boot up my iisi i get the flashing question mark sometimes if i
then insert the silverlining program i can get it to recognize the drive
by making it scan over and over for drives at that point i can restart the
iisi and boot from the hd i ve called la cie again and they ve given me
another rma their tech support people tell me that if silverlining doesn t see
the drive there s a definite hardware problem given that this is the second bad drive in four months i asked la cie to send
me a new one but they said no also within three weeks after i purchased
my original drive la cie dropped the price on it by over i can accept that a drive or two may be bad and i know that hardware vendors
make a practice of sending reconditioned replacements when they do repairs and
i understand that the nature of the computer industry lends itself to sudden
price fluctuations nevertheless taken together the convergence of these
facts events have left a bad taste in my mouth i should have added above that
when i asked la cie to transfer the contents of my current drive to the one
they will send i think the data is still in good shape and i ll have to again
reinstall everything from floppies they said it would cost me for data
recovery it seems to me that reconditioned hardware should be sold as reconditioned at a
discounted price and that replacements for new hardware gone bad still
covered under a day warranty should be new i feel a little helpless about all this i don t mean to necessarily flame la
cie their support staff have always been friendly and sometimes even helpful but c mon sometimes a little extra customer service goes a long way i sent
a letter to la cie s customer service when the first drive was returned and i
asked them for a credit on the price difference since i had purchased the drive
three weeks before they slashed the price i told them i would like to apply
the credit toward the purchase of another la cie product they didn t even have the courtesy to reply one way or the other what s the moral of this story i m not sure but i do know i won t buy any
other products from la cie in the future bill krauthammer ps please don t email or post about how good your la cie product and service

50495.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"i can only comment on thermal recalibration in general some new
drives perform it in order to increase overall integrity of data
writes basically the firmware instructs the actuator to perform
a test to see if the data tracks are within a certain physical
tolerance since when the media heats up or cools down some track drift is inevitable and the drive has to monitor it this
becomes especially critical at very high recording densities and
so was used primarily on very large capacity mechanisms but it
seems to be finding its way into more smaller drives as a way of
boosting the drive s long term reliability and mtbf ratings i first became aware of thermal recalibration when it was pointed
out that the technique conflicts with prolonged write times when
digitizing say audio or video to hard disk some manufacturers
explicitly state that drives with thermal recalibration are not
to be used for applications that have prolonged disk writes hope this helps victor"

50541.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"here s a question that may be simple enough to answer but has stumped
myself and a few others what does an external ram cache card do for you if you already have a large
cache set through control panel in your simms ex i have a mac iici with meg ram an external video card so i don t
rob my simm s and the default apple cache card i believe this is k say i have my cache set at meg what good does a measly k do me on the
cache card could it actually slow things down by dividing the cache
between the card and the simm s or does it still speed things up by
providing a secondary staging area for data normally passed directly into
the simm ram cache i m confused because it seems like cache cards are so low in memory to
really do any good compared to what you can set yourself yet daystar
fastcache has numbers which show around a performance boost on some
operations are the chips on the cache card simply faster than most simm
accesses please help i m trying to find the optimum memory settings for the iici
system described in the ex above patrick"
50542.eml,comp.sys.mac.hardware,"hello all i am thinking about buying an external monitor for my se and was
wondering if anyone out in netland has any advice for me i am mostly thinking about a color monitor and an bit card that
can switch between and something higher like i read an
old report on a card from lapis that could do this but could not use the
external monitor as the main screen with menubar which to me is a major draw back has this perhaps been fixed or can any other cards do this like the
micron xceed also which monitor should i buy at the moment i am leaning towards
the sony s or what exactly is the difference between these but are there any other good cheap monitors i should know about doesn t the
monitor have to be multisync to support cards that can switch resolutions please send me e mail and i ll summarize i would also greatly appreciate getting the e mail addresses of any mail order

x
xwhat is new in x
x the entry format is better for us anyway the program mkentry c
x has been updated see entry format x
x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c
x compiler certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers x fits are no longer permitted some of the new issues deal with x non integral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor x directives and the exit function see our likes and dislikes x
x
xhints and suggestions x
x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests see
x for more information for details on how to get previous winners x
x keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries
x may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year
x might be old the next year x
x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways we typically apply
x a number of tests to an entry x
x look at the original source
x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii
x c pre process the source ignoring include lines
x c pre process the source ignoring define and include lines
x run it through a c beautifier
x examine the algorithm
x lint it
x compile it
x execute it
x
x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
x cleaned up by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x
x your entry need not do well under all or in most tests in certain
x cases a test is not important entries that compete for the
x strangest most creative source layout need not do as well as
x others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand given
x two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that
x does something interesting when you run it x
x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such we leave
x the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real life
x programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
x is important for this reason we often award worst abuse of the
x rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x
x if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know
x in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abuse
x is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to the
x byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends to
x annoy more than amuse x
x we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries
x to attempt to exploit them we will award worst abuse of the rules x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use
x the smallest plug needed if not smaller x
x check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes make
x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly
x in or near the final round on the other hand we have seen some
x of the best entries fall down because they didn t work x
x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that
x is a prime number if you do have a bug you are better off
x documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the th power
x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes x a strange bug feature can even help the entry of course a correctly
x working entry is best x
x
xour likes and dislikes x
x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old we
x tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor tests
x that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar won t go as far
x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x
x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x
x define d define
x d foo use instead x
x if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef x the leading must be the first character on a line while some
x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not x
x because the exit function returns void on some systems entries
x must not assume that it returns an int x
x small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do
x serve a useful purpose they are often the only program that people
x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for
x programs that are compact and are instructional x
x one line programs should be short one line programs say around x bytes long getting close to bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x
x we tend to dislike programs that x
x are very hardware specific
x are very os or un x version specific
x index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specific
x code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings
x it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x won t compile under both bsd or sys v un x
x abusing the build file to get around the size limit
x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs
x are longer than they need to be
x are similar to previous winners
x are identical to previous losers x
x unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the
x best one liner category we suggest that you format your program
x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x
x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size
x limit it is one thing to make use of a several d s to help out x but it is quite another to use bytes of d s in order to
x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel
x free to make use of the build file space but you are better off
x if you show some amount of restraint x
x we allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impact
x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get
x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x
x given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob
x of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c
x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third
x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
x and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x
x we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating x program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
x to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicating
x programs in fact a number of winners have been self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x know of a smaller one x
x x client entries should be as portable as possible entries that
x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored don t
x depend on a particular type of display for example don t depend
x on color or a given size don t require backing store x
x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and
x software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such x client
x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the
x athena widget set libx a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x don t use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone
x has them avoid depending on a particular window manager not
x everyone has x r and some people are stuck back in x r or
x earlier so try to target x r without requiring x r better

x we like programs that x
x are as concise and small as they need to be
x do something at least quasi interesting
x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable
x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation
x make us laugh and or throw up x
x some types of programs can t excel in some areas of course your
x program doesn t have to excel in all areas but doing well in several
x areas really does help x
x we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in
x the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had to
x read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x
x be creative x
x
xentry format x
x in order to help us process the many entries we must request your
x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way this format x in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the
x author from the program itself see judging process x
x we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to
x format entries you should be aware of the following warning that
x is found in mkentry c x
x	this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules every
x	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
x	an entry that conforms to the contest rules in all cases x	where this program differs from the contest rules the
x	contest rules will be used be sure to check with the
x	contest rules before submitting an entry x
x you are not required to use mkentry it is convenient however x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check
x the entry against the size rules x
x if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about
x the mkentry c program please send email to the judges see below x
x the following is a sample entry x

x we do not limit ourselves to this list for example a few entries are so
x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x
x in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of
x reducing the remaining entries typically about down to or x winners often we are confident that the entries that make it into
x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
x make it the selection of the winners out of the final round is
x less clear cut x
x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out
x by a similar but slightly better entry for this reason it is
x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year this assumes of course x that the entry is worth improving in the first place x
x more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a
x strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest
x rules in some way x
x in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best sometimes such
x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often the
x best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x
x
xannouncement of winners x
x the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference by tradition x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof just prior to
x the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x
x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups x
x comp lang c comp unix wizards	alt sources
x
x in addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following

xdrawpoint calls and for reasons unknown to me the point calls are failing

rightward direction over the drawing area but after the move is still on
some part of the drawing area this also happens less consistently when the
pulldown popup is moved in the leftward direction assuming that my code is not doing anything incredibly odd is this a server

xabout this file x
x this file is intended to help people who wish to submit entries to
x the international obfuscated c code contest ioccc for short x
x this is not the ioccc rules though it does contain comments about
x them the guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are
x allowed even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines x
x you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x
x changes from the draft are noted by change bars x
x
xwhat is new in x
x the entry format is better for us anyway the program mkentry c
x has been updated see entry format x
x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c
x compiler certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers
x fits are no longer permitted some of the new issues deal with
x non integral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor
x directives and the exit function see our likes and dislikes x
x
xhints and suggestions x
x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests see
x for more information for details on how to get previous winners x
x keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries
x may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year
x might be old the next year x
x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways we typically apply
x a number of tests to an entry x
x look at the original source
x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii
x c pre process the source ignoring include lines
x c pre process the source ignoring define and include lines
x run it through a c beautifier
x examine the algorithm
x lint it
x compile it
x execute it
x
x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been
x cleaned up by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x
x your entry need not do well under all or in most tests in certain
x cases a test is not important entries that compete for the
x strangest most creative source layout need not do as well as
x others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand given
x two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that
x does something interesting when you run it x
x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such we leave
x the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real life
x programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request
x is important for this reason we often award worst abuse of the
x rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x
x if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know
x in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abuse
x is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to the
x byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends to
x annoy more than amuse x
x we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries
x to attempt to exploit them we will award worst abuse of the rules x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use
x the smallest plug needed if not smaller x
x check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes make
x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly
x in or near the final round on the other hand we have seen some
x of the best entries fall down because they didn t work x
x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that
x is a prime number if you do have a bug you are better off
x documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the th power
x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes x a strange bug feature can even help the entry of course a correctly
x working entry is best x
x
xour likes and dislikes x
x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old we
x tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor tests
x that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar won t go as far
x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x
x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x
x define d define
x d foo use instead x
x if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef x the leading must be the first character on a line while some
x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not x
x because the exit function returns void on some systems entries
x must not assume that it returns an int x
x small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do
x serve a useful purpose they are often the only program that people
x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for
x programs that are compact and are instructional x
x one line programs should be short one line programs say around x bytes long getting close to bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x
x we tend to dislike programs that x
x are very hardware specific
x are very os or un x version specific
x index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specific
x code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings
x it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x won t compile under both bsd or sys v un x
x abusing the build file to get around the size limit
x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs
x are longer than they need to be
x are similar to previous winners
x are identical to previous losers x
x unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the
x best one liner category we suggest that you format your program
x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x
x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size
x limit it is one thing to make use of a several d s to help out x but it is quite another to use bytes of d s in order to
x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel
x free to make use of the build file space but you are better off
x if you show some amount of restraint x
x we allowed whitespace and in certain cases or do not impact
x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get
x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x
x given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob
x of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c
x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third
x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting
x and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x
x we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating x program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim
x to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicating
x programs in fact a number of winners have been self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x know of a smaller one x
x x client entries should be as portable as possible entries that
x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored don t
x depend on a particular type of display for example don t depend
x on color or a given size don t require backing store x
x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and
x software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such x client
x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the
x athena widget set libx a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x don t use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone
x has them avoid depending on a particular window manager not
x everyone has x r and some people are stuck back in x r or
x earlier so try to target x r without requiring x r better
x yet try to make your entry run on all version x window systems x
x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on
x xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the required lines
x in the remark section x
x we like programs that x
x are as concise and small as they need to be
x do something at least quasi interesting
x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable
x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style
x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation
x make us laugh and or throw up x
x some types of programs can t excel in some areas of course your
x program doesn t have to excel in all areas but doing well in several
x areas really does help x
x we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in
x the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had to
x read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x
x be creative x
x
xentry format x
x in order to help us process the many entries we must request your
x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way this format x in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the
x author from the program itself see judging process x
x we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to
x format entries you should be aware of the following warning that
x is found in mkentry c x
x	this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules every
x	attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces
x	an entry that conforms to the contest rules in all cases x	where this program differs from the contest rules the
x	contest rules will be used be sure to check with the
x	contest rules before submitting an entry x
x you are not required to use mkentry it is convenient however x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check
x the entry against the size rules x
x if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about
x the mkentry c program please send email to the judges see below x
x the following is a sample entry x
x entry xrule xfix n
xtitle chonglab

x we do not limit ourselves to this list for example a few entries are so
x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x
x in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of
x reducing the remaining entries typically about down to or x winners often we are confident that the entries that make it into
x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not
x make it the selection of the winners out of the final round is
x less clear cut x
x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out
x by a similar but slightly better entry for this reason it is
x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry
x that failed to win in a previous year this assumes of course x that the entry is worth improving in the first place x
x more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a
x strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest
x rules in some way x
x in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best sometimes such
x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often the
x best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x
x
xannouncement of winners x
x the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference by tradition x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof just prior to
x the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x
x winning entries will be posted in late june to the following groups x
x comp lang c comp unix wizards	alt sources
x
x in addition pointers to these postings are posted to the following
x
x comp sources d alt sources d misc misc
x comp sources misc comp windows x
x
x winning entries will be deposited into the uunet archives see

x often winning entries are published in selected magazines winners
x have appeared in books the new hackers dictionary and on t shirts x

jan root display with hp vue jan all i can do with vue is display xbm s through their
jan backdrop style manager jan xv does not seem to be able to override whatever vue
jan puts there i suspect this is because vue creates a window probably overrideredirect that is the size of or larger than the root window because the window
manager does not know about this you cannot move resize etc it xv in the
mean time is busy changing your root window to whatever you have requested
but you never get to see it because vue s window is overlaid on top of the root
window contact hp support and see whether vue can support coloured bitmap format
such as xpm if they cant then they probably create all their coloured
backdrops inside the code"

of any other person or organization but i have heard that ford motor company has had a recruiting bias
toward engineers and away from computer science graduates the reasoning
is supposedly to better meet long range personnel requirements this is
evidenced by the large number of cs people who are employed via contracts

a generalization which obviously doesn t always hold true but there are
statistics furthermore most software engineering at ford gets done
by electrical engineers i know of univerities that have merged the

can get a computer degree which qualifies you for much more than programming but since my beliefs and opinions are merely figments of my distorted

of what the gui users are doing not about what they actually are doing this abstract model is only apparent from the perpective of a programmer of the system nb some users may see it too but only when they put
aside the work at hand and start thinking like a programmer i m not saying that the programmer s perspective is evil or stunted after
all that s what i do too i am saying that ui designers must carefully
distinguish between the user programmer conceptual models and they must
ultimately serve the user of the system not the builder of the system i don t recall the actual stats but something like in people can be categorized as a symbol manipulator it would be interesting to know more about the meaning and basis for this
claim at any rate i don t think this is evidence that of users think
like programmers bankers financial analysts structural engineers these are all people whose work you could characterize as primarily symbol
manipulation but what they do is not programming and programming is not
required to do what they do to restate my previous point yes users want to build their own solutions no they do not want to do programming to accomplish this"

of rogue wave s view h i like view h s abstractions best of all of the
toolkits i mentioned but the resulting code looks little like motif and i
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code gina allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance but the resulting code is almost too motif like and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent c code interviews looks
promising but i haven t found a free version with motif support and i m
not confident how widely interviews with motif support will be adopted and what if any specific motif support will be available over time the
other libraries produce code which is less motif like but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of c to simplify my coding task at this point my inclination is to write my motif manipulation routines in
c and invoke those routines from my c code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task later if osf or some credible standards setting body
comes up with a c interface to motif i will change to that it does me
no goo to write in c if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions it s better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now views h is the only
library i d consider right now but in our environment we d end up spending
nearly to use it and i can t justify it when it s likely to cause
short term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently long lived solution for us to reap the benefits

66903.eml,comp.windows.x,i think you will find that the active linux and bsd communities are populated by enthusiasts who would object to paying any money for software otherwise they would probably have gone for a commercial unix an important factor in the linux community is that source code is always available this is probably similar in the bsd community however i m not really involved there many people using linux like to stay at the cutting bleeding edge ie when kernel patches c library or compiler patches come out people like to rebuild their entire systems the prime requirement for all linux software is that it is available under a gnu style public license hence linux software uses either the athena widgets or xview individuals may write software requiring motif but i doubt it is widely adopted regards richard gooch

75854.eml,misc.forsale,"pc game for sale waxworks by horrorsoft accolade by the same folks who brought you elvira i ii i played
elvira i ii and think that horrorsoft has finally made
a very playable game with waxworks the look and feel is
roughly the same as in the elvira games though the real time
fighting is a little easier to survive the first two games especially elvira ii jaws of cerberus made it very tough to
stay alive and hit point restoring was very difficult this is not to say that waxworks is a walk in the park but it is
quite fair in that there is always some weapon to be found
that is quite effective or hint given as to the proper fighting
strategy in one of the four wax works to be explored there is no fighting at all well almost none though all four contain
moderately challanging puzzles the really interesting thing about this game is that it is really broken up into four seperate rpgs one for each of the four exhibits
you must enter in starting each one your character is transported
with no objects to use and experience level one exhibits traps
you inside a multi level ancient egyptian pyramid which you must escape by fighting mapping and puzzle solving another exhibit
traps you in a mine that has been taken over by creeping plant vines
and pods while the local humans have been transformed into plant
zombies this is a single level maze that requires you to rescue
some humans kill the head plant alien and figuere out how to kill
the very tuff plant zombies that are always showing up this is
perhaps the most horrifying exhibit another exhibit puts you into
jack the ripper england where you appear by the corpse of a fresh ripper
victim and of course the police think you are responsible you must
avoid police and angry mobs to unravel the mystery of the ripper and meet him face to face but first get a disquise the last exhibit
pus you in a graveyard where most of the challenge is in learning to stop the almost indestructible zombies over all the vga graphics and music are very effective in setting a creepy tone for the game as was the case for the elvira games though
gameplay is much improved and makes for a much more enjoyable game i heartily recommend it for rpg and horror fans"

weak and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint the inspection garage said that they won t pass it unless i get a
waiver from the state police so i went to the state police the
officer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal and i can get a
waiver only for a pre car or for a medical reason i asked him to
show me the section of the vehicle code that says it s illegal he
showed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can t have tint if
you can t see the inside of the car because of the tint when i told
him that you can in fact see the inside very well he shut the book
and said it s just illegal and in fact we can have someone give you
a ticket for it right now well won t argue with that since the vehicle code says it s ok as long as you can see through the
tint i d like to keep it i ll re read the vehicle code in the
library i d also like to get some sort of paper from the police
that says it s ok so i can get the inspection and so that i won t
get in trouble for the tint later on i also wouldn t mind registering
a complaint against that officer he really pissed me off so does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from
the police especially in pennsylvania does anyone have any experience
registering a complaint against an officer i called the station later on today but they basically said there is no place where i

platforms their interior etc is good enough to warrant slightly higher
prices here are some of the platform derivations i can think of tercel paseo
sentra nx nx civic del sol mx not sure on this one stylus impulse storm to illustrate a tercel starts at around while the paseo starts at
around even a door tercel will cost less than a door paseo now you might be saying that the tercel doesn t offer the power that some doors
offer what i mean is that there is no dr tercel with a comparable
powerplant as its sport coupe derivative let s take another example the
isuzu stylus xs and impulse xs storm gsi both have the same powerplants a l hp engine but the smaller dr coupes are generally more expensive again this is because the two door sport coupe market is a more
fashion oriented and trend setting segment people are willing to pay more

102742.eml,rec.autos,"i consulted with someone working on an electronic odometer the
design was to use a microprocessor based system to write a somewhat
ofuscated pattern into an eeprom the idea was to make the circuit
difficult to program arbitrary values into the eeprom the
secondary purpose acutally the primary purpose from the standpoint
of practicality was to distributed the writes so as to avoid
exceeing the maximum number of writes fof the eeprom being used the microprocessor also ignored pulses coming from the hall effect
at a rate any higher than mph so as to make spoofing the reading
by bench pulsing at least somewhat undesirable this was for an
automobile that was not expected to ever exceed mph in
operation the case of course might not be the same for your rx the ecm modules of some cars do indeed store info about conditions
under which cars have been operated since steering angle and
velocity data etc is available it would not be difficult to
collect all sorts of interesting demographic information about the
drivers use of the car i am not aware of any manufacturer
currently trying to enforce warranty restrictions based on reading
out use data from the ecm while it could be a potential invasion
of your privacy for manufacturers to have access to data about your

102744,rec.autos,"howdy i m a little new to this newsgroup but i would like to tap some of the
knowledge and expertise available here the subject after market cruise controls the background i recently broke my ankle in a road bicycling accident places five screws yuk in two weeks i will be returning to texas my
home from my school byu in provo utah as you can imagine trying to
drive nearly miles with a broken right ankle isn t just the epitome of
a good time my car does not have a cruise control so i would have to do
all the pedalling ha ha with my messed up ankle my question what is the general opinion of after market cruise control units i
realize that a cheap cc cruise control from say pep boys isn t going to
be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit if there is such a
thing and i uderstand that i probably can t expect much in the way of
accuracy looks and that sort of thing but anything s gotta be better than
trying to drive with a hosed ankle i have a jeep cherokee speed standard l engine with
kettering sp ignition y know distributor cap rotor that set up not
electronic maybe you could ve guessed it being an but i m just trying
to give information as completly as i can i found a cc unit for bucks it seems to use the vehicles vacuum system instead of an electric servor motor is this good or bad if i did buy
this cc which vacuum hose should i tap it has two speed sensors one magnetic and one that gets a signal from the negative side of the distributor kinda like a tach pick up or so i
understand i can use either one which is best the manual says i read
it in the store today that the magnetic axle set up is more accurate but
harder to install is there really a big difference it has a sensor for the brake pedal just like other ccs but does not have a
sensor for the clutch pedal so if i wasn t paying real close attention i
might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up which
would wind the engine up kinda high until i got my wits about me and turned the thing off i m pretty coordinated so this doesn t bother me if it
were for my girlfriends car then it would bother me but i m ok with it the installation also calls for an attachment to a steady on brake signal
and a switched on brake signal i think i can get a switched brake signal
from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse am i right but i m
not sure where to get the steady on brake signal or for that matter what
exactly it is any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get
it i think i can figure the other things out like how to hook up the negative
side tach type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit and the ground and
all that miscellaneous business but i need a little help with is it worth the money and safety risk if any for such a device is there any particularly good after market cc are professionally installed ccs signifacantly better and worth the cabbage if the unit i saw sorry no manufacturer or model number just that it is at pep boy and its is sufficient for my simple needs how do i get the thing installed properly specifically the questions above my father and i built a veep volkswagen powered jeep cj a when i was in
high school so i consider myself fairly good with tools electronics and
cars so the installation doesn t scare me i just want to be certain that
i get the thing installed correctly as my cherokee is just a wee bit more
complicated than my veep i appreciate your time in reading my post and i would appreciate any
expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject if you would like to share

fast speeds to be riding a motorcycle what do you have to say for
your self well sir meekly the defenant replied i just was over to my

101666,rec.sport.baseball,"i agree and disagree john is saying that the batters efforts will result
in more wins then losses while you are probably correct that does not mean more wins then losses it means something i would
rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by in
each of pas then i would a player who increased my chances of winning
by in each of pas thus there appears to me to be an obvious
positive association between john s statistic and winning games thus before you disregard this stat it appears to me that further study must
go into what sort of relationship there is the only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly
how many wins the team has first we are using averages over many
seasons and applying them to one game second remember some players
performance take away from the chance of you winning that is a
player who gets an out gets a negative probability in most cases thus i m not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers
for a team who won that they will add up to in that game sometimes they will add up to more then one sometime less than one also the pitchers bad performances giving up runs may have given
them a large negative percentage for that game also any batter that
pulled an night would give large negatives no but really only because you have a smaller sample size i would
think however that the number of runs you score in the first inning
would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score in the last inning and realize something else a closer usually
comes in in a close situation not a blow out it is hard to argue
that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance
to those given up in the first inning look a closer giving up runs
often means a team will lose many games on the other hand a starter
who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win the
offence has many more outs to do something about but i am not
saying all late inning situations are equally important either if
i am down runs in the ninth it really does not matter how many
runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth no but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would
be before the possesion in which the free throws were made look if you are down point with seconds left there is a fairly high
probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the
ball and do not forget that somebody elses missed shots turnovers fouls bad defense etc caused a negative chance that the team
would win from reading all of the discussion on this statistic i feel that those
who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda at first look this statistic valadates clutchness but it really
does not cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players
in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance
goes down i ve never seen convincing proof that this really happens so if you assume there is no clutchness then that means that except
for a lot of noice this statistic has a positive association to
player performance there is a way to get rid of the noice if you
do not believe in clutchness certainly we could find out what
the average value of a home run is for example we may find for
instance that a home run increases your chance of winning by on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by i bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just
as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses how do we evaluate relief pitchers say john and sam have the
exact same pitching statistics runs earned runs k s bb s etc both had exceptional numbers john however only pitched
in closer situations while sam was a mop up man who was more
valuble to their team probably john who was the better pitcher they were probably about the same brian smith"

game series one friday one saturday and a good old sunday doubleheader what could be better declared ernie banks perhaps the fact that the cubs
are challenging it s pitching it s always been pitching that we ve lacked announced
ryne sandberg if we can get by brewer then beat carlton alexander or
bunning preferrably of the last three we ll know we might be able to
win lord i hope we pull it off the phils scored once in the top of the first richie ashburn singled pete
rose followed with a hit sending ashburn around second kiki cuyler cut
the ball off in left center and threw a bullet in to ernie banks who threw
to ron santo to get ashburn at third rose went to second on the play christobel torrienti lifted a long fly to center moving pete rose to
third schmidt was walked the cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them both torrienti and schmidt will likely draw walks this
year chuck klein is starting to hit very well and he lashed a double into a
gap in right center cool papa bell s speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent schmidt from scoring nellie fox was walked and bob boone
grounded out to second ending the threat teams are starting to realize that you don t have to pitch to schmidt or
torrienti and that is lowering their run total it puts a lot of pressure on
klein and dick allen who platoons with chuck klein and occasionally spells
rose at first and it s a credit to the phillies that they ve been able to
sustain their pace the picthers have slumped at times so came the
analysis from frank chance the cubs got that run back when bell bunted for a hit thomas grounder
moved him to second and after sandberg made out billy williams singled
home a run in the sixth ron santo launched a two run homer to make it dick redding got in trouble in the eighth as schmidt singled and klein
singled him to third ed reulbach entered to face fox but dick allen popped
out of the dugout to hit allen doubled to right but luckily for the cubs williams had moved to left and andre dawson had been inserted for defense he fired a bullet to home plate to keep klein at third lance parrish hitting
for boone was walked and bruce sutter entered larry bowa grounded into
a double play but ed delahanty walked as a pinch hitter desiring a
strikeout since ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
trillo pinch running at third chance brought in lee smith who induced a
pop up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder ending the inning the
cubs took the win moving a game behind the phillies steve carlton was called upon to battle finger brown saturday to get
another righthander in the lineup ron santo moved to first and bill madlock
played third unfortunately brown allowed six doubles and the cub bullpen
was worn down even more as the cubs tried to maintain a lead against
lefty madlock batting sixth had knocked two doubles of his own driving
home four runs gabby hartnett hit two home runs and cuyler added
another and the score was cubs after six innings the phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth as the cubs grabbed more
runs to ice an triumph sunday s twin bill saw cool papa bell gather seven straight hits at one
point including a rare outside the park home run in the second game off
robin roberts grover alexander of the phils took the first contest but

alomar is a fine defensive catcher which was my statement above that is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded seasoning sorry new don t know nichols law don t believe in catchers era but i am interested in pitchers eras with different catchers any info on that in other words we know more than they do so the only logic behind a different decision than we would make must be financial i presume

lopez on the farm then that s what the braves should do i happen to believe that it s a baseball decision while you from
your armchair may disagee i don t i think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made i predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training i
think it is a very normal decision to have made it is certainly

mistake being made by the sdcn s as they are known on this group with respect to players like bo and deion and lofton and perhaps others we find that if you look at a large group of players their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well their are some caveats the younger they are the less good the prediction the lower the minor league the less good i imagine the more recent
the player has left college ball etc now of course this prediction involves quite a bit of error sometimes
a player with poor mle s dave justice the ventura becomes a star some hitters develop shane mack brian downing some don t oddibe
mcdowell mickey brantley this error involves real things there are
real reasons why oddibe didn t hit and shane did it may who knows involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on but still you have this big pool of players and things work pretty well one of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players one thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them or almost all have spent a good deal of time playing
ball their backgrounds are similar what hasn t been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background is there some reason to believe that a
bo or a deion or a lofton or a tony gwynn or an ainge or so
on has such a different background that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly it hasn t been established that you can use mle s with two sport players it hasn t been established that you can t but then statistics is after
all an art i personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about bo and deion and lofton look at those good but not great minor league numbers they say well what happens if those numbers simply don t mean what they usually mean it might mean that ken lofton suddenly has a better year in houston than
tuscon it might mean that deion suddenly has a better half year in
atlanta than greenville then again it might not ken and deion might go right back in the tank
this year live up to those poor mle s but you guys don t know what s worse you don t know that you don t and you don t know that there are other players you won t know about injuries and lifting and wheaties again you seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal it s not it s got some error oh well bill guilford still thinks hairy butt is truly ugly might be right"

102668.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"mark singer said yes but this is irrelevant you re talking about averages when we
have lots of information about this player in particular to base our
decisions on i might as well say we know that very very few people are more than feet
tall so chances are that manute bol is really only foot why isn t lopez likely to hit that well he hit that well last year after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such he hit better on an
absolute scale than olson or berryhill did by a lot as for rushing if there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment and i don t
believe there is then wouldn t you rather waste lopez s year old good
season than his year old very good season or his year old excellent
season the sooner you get him acclimated the more of his prime you get to
use the point was not that ab is a significant sample but rather that he
hadn t done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real or to send him
down until he gets warmed up most players are never ready for the bigs what does this have to do
with javy lopez see above but i could apply the same reasoning to frank thomas or barry bonds most
players aren t that good so they probably won t be that good this year
either and demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble not superstars not stars not even good players maybe average if we re
being charitable ummm justice is a very fine hitter pendleton might have another big year
in his bat but he might also spend the season in hamstring hell gant is a
big question mark the bream hunter platoon is decent not excellent and
has rotten obp or slg depending on who s in blauser is a very valuable
bat for a shortstop wanna bet the difference between lopez s bat and olson berryhill could be or runs over the course of the season given a choice between a player
with experience and a player who can play i ll take the latter every time just like keith mitchell did that was me and you so far your only counter proposal is that they
really don t understand how good lopez is or overvalue experience or some combination of the two i think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization well argued but inflammatory reply deleted"
102669.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"mark singer said catcher is their weakest position with the possible exception of second base they have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well above average offensive player and acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team and they
want to play olson and berryhill instead a catcher s defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his recent offensive level of performance thus mickey tettleton goes in the media from being a no hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb finger in two short years the rule doesn t apply to perceived superstars who get the gold glove offensive transfer effect instead greg olson is probably considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can t hit aren t they the same thing either that or just stupidity of course one could make the same sort of argument in other cases pete rose in
pursuing ty cobb s record was a huge gate attraction and national media
magnet the reds made a lot of money off that they also wasted the prime

102693.eml,rec.sport.baseball,"since i was the one responsible for these divergent threads of
approx posts going back to the braves could be better off
if an injury happens i may as well inject a little more
fuel to the flame back at the beginning of spring training i though
lopez would make the squad easily olson was still
recovering from his late season injury knee i believe and there were questions as to whether he would be
able to play before june and then berryhill was dinged up i was looking forward to this because i believe that lopez
can hit and field the position before last season he was
the braves defensive catcher prospect while brian deak was
the braves offensive catcher prospect besides olson
and berryhill couldn t hit their way out of a wet cardboard
box and don t walk enough to be useful but olson recovered quickly berryhill recovered and the braves went
with the two vets i still say that if one of those two had been down
at the start of the season he wouldn t have gotten his job back there is a certain logic to keeping olson and berryhill around after all ml catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and
tear there are teams out there without one average ml catcher california and seattle come to mind certainly trying to
move olson or berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work plus you d have to eat that salary which isn t huge but isn t
tiddleywinks either i think olson s at about berryhill
at but that s only what i recall yes i think arbitration eligibility may have a role to
play in this also what is it that of the year players
aren t eligible for arbitration only the that were on the roster
the longest are eligible of course the system may change but the extent of that change is not yet known from a business
standpoint it may make sense to keep lopez down until june the
first time olson berryhill go on the dl i am still disappointed that lopez isn t on the team i still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the braves and the truth is that i d rather see our best team on the field which imo includes lopez of course today we play the cubs hopefully we won t need him as for the schuerholz cox conversation i imagine it went
like this remember they ve both been gm s the following is not meant to be read by the humor impaired cox ok we ve sent jones down his fielding could be a
little smoother besides blauser can hit ok and his fielding
is better than it used to be schuerholz well we ll have to send nieves down too deion
just won t sign that baseball only contract we can t count
on him in october so we have to keep nixon around for the
defense besides gorman s not ready to give up on
billy hatcher yet once hatcher s gone and deion signs we can move nixon for frankie rodriguez that ought to
give us some pitching depth in cox yep that ll be nice too bad deion won t sign ok i ll look for nieves when justice starts having
berry berry er back problems again now what about
klesko schuerholz well we ve still got to fork out another mil
for bream if we keep klesko we either lose the money
or cabrera i keep dangling sid in front of dal maxwell but somehow he doesn t seem to be the same gm first
jeffries for jose and now whiten for clark if he
gets rid of brian jordan then i d have to believe that he
and whitey herzog switched bodies at the winter meetings cox ok keep trying on bream and i ll wait til the trading
deadline for my hunter klesko platoon maybe i can get a few
extra at bats for cabrera while we wait try california if snow starts slowly maybe whiteydal will bite on sid and if that doesn t work then perhaps sid s knees
could be persuaded to act up there s always the day dl mwa ha ha ha ha schuerholz what about caraballo cox well he s not that much better than lemke maybe if he starts
in richmond he ll start walking more besides if he s going to be
arbitration eligible better to stretch him out so that we actually
get some value from him before he makes the big bucks schuerholz now let s see that leaves lopez cox nooooo i gotta keep lopez sure i didn t think olson
would recover this quickly maybe i can talk caminiti into
running into him again schuerholz nope lopez has gotta go you know that he ll get million in arbitration may as well put it off that one
extra year besides until olson s shown his stuff a little
bit i can t trade him besides berryhill s a left handed
hitter you know how rare that is cox don t you mean a left handed whiffer pretty common if you ask me i mean he made pat borders look good in
the world series pat borders schuerholz hey you re the one who wouldn t write lopez
into the lineup cox well you re the one who went out and got me jeff
reardon besides i thought lopez wouldn t be used
to our pitching staff s stuff he got some time with
them this spring looked pretty good come on surely
we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate schuerholz yeah but which stiff whichever one we keep
will be hurt by may cox ok ok you made your point keep them both surely
one of them will be on the dl by june at the latest then i
can call up lopez and then we can win games the pennant the world series i ll be up there with john mcgraw casey
stengel earl weaver oh they laughed at me in toronto but have you ever had to deal with george bell i ll finally

to cubs a big edge shortstop vizcaino vs weiss vizcaino is excellent defensively but is an
automatic out at bat weiss isn t much better with the stick even third base dave magadan vs buechelle magadan has a higher obp and is a better hitter buechelle has more power and is better defensively i think edge to

himself i give maldonado the edge however like at b this is position
where florida might be even or better if the player there has a huge year center scott pose vs wilson may edge to may even if wilson hopefully the

isn t ken griffey jr but he will hit with homers if he plays

sosa but sosa also has speed and a good glove edge to cubs starters aquino armstrong hammond a lot of fifth starters here the cubs won t

is average to ok better than the marline edge to cubs middle relief even the cubs have some decent middlemen and so do the marlins carpenter anf klink or decent but so are assenmacher and mcelroy closer a healthy harvey is a big edge to the marlins meyers is decent but

better than what i have i want him out there sandy alomar had decent
minor league numbers grossly inflated by the pcl in general and las
vegas in particular he should have been projected as an average major
league hitter which is good for a catcher i ll admit santiago s
numbers would probably come out the same as sandy s but i don t have
the league data from the mid s to check it out that being said i agree with sending lopez to richmond at least to
start the season as the box below shows he has one minor league
season in which he hit well he has two in which he hit very very
poorly i want to see that the lopez is real olson and berryhill
are not complete mediocrities for catchers especially nl catchers they are essentially average hitters with equivalent averages around if he had hit well at prior levels i would say he belongs on
the braves but there is a reasonable chance that lopez last year was

you would expect from his aaa numbers the same season he got pas the
next year at age and still underperformed however the next year at
age his performance improved and he won the everyday shortstop job and has been there ever since it s really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league where he was
performed quite well in aaa during this time rather than being rushed cleveland might have been better off i suppose because they might have

sdcn and the non sdcn camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher s
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present you can talk about how
important calling a game is or framing the pitches or blocking balls
in the dirt but there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher s rank in defense looking at lopez specifically is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the braves or the media has labeled him a bad defensive catcher as far as i
can tell he doesn t have any particular problem in his mechanics such as sasser he might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time i can t see how repetitions
at aaa are any better then reps in the majors all we re left with is the calling the game aspect olsen and
berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff but this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers how is catching at aaa going to help lopez learn
the major league pitching staff the only way any catcher is going to
learn tom glavine s pitches is to catch tom glavine similarly i wouldn t
be supprised if the pitcher s claimed to prefer pitching to olsen over
pitching to lopez because they are used to pitching to olsen but given time they will say they are comfortable with lopez now since lopez can t learn how to handle the major league
pitcher s while he s in aaa and since he doesn t have any glaring

one pittsburgh was still getting better so people continued to support
them if they suddenly dropped to say points you d have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon ok my numbers came from the nhl guide and record book you can give the credit to mario since he deserves it but my point is that
it wasn t mario himself but it was the expectation of things to come i e a winning team that he created by being the next great hockey superstar and
before anybody jumps in and says i m nit picking and mincing words go back
and read from where this thread started it might help to think about what would go through a fan s mind who suddenly
found an interest in mario and the pens was it gee mario lemieux is
amazing i ll go watch him play or was it gee now we ve got a kick ass guy on our side i ll go watch him play i think it was the latter i don t think this is accurate the tickets sell but people don t go to
the games i think this thread has already been discussed season ticket
holders in la don t always use their tickets so in effect after the kings
initial success following gretzky s arrival to points same source and corresponding attendance jump there has been an effective drop in
attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much whether or not the kings are a winner is debatable i claim that since
gretzky s arrival they have at the very least been competitive i also claim
that mcnall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the oiler
dynasty but that s another story and included only because i don t like
mcnall anyway mcnall did do some heavy marketing around gretzky and
that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising
sales etc but as i said when the kings have been in there little
tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the
forum even if the tickets were sold for the short term imo although i think that it s inevitable that the team
will improve with a player such as lemieux or gretzky simply because they
make people around them better well at least we are in full agreement here so are you saying roger has ever had a valid point yes but they are doing no worse than last year i think the same type of
reasoning i applied to a new pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people
showing up at winnipeg games it s difficult to predict but do you think
that if the jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they
will maintain their attendance levels i seriously doubt it because in that
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone with or without

count neither do selanne s knowledgeable hockey observers the world over would agree that
feeding selanne so he can score does contribute in a meaningful way to

that huge defensive liability paul coffey kelly hrudey is only the biggest
disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with but at best he s
only a mediocre goaltender a better choice would be tomas sandstrom though
not through any fault of his own but because some thugs in toronto decided to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal other than that the
award goes to robert lang an uninspiring czech robitaille could easily be
mvp but i d prefer to give it to rob blake who is quietly becoming one of the
league s premier defensemen and if the kings manage to hold onto him and the rest of our young defense it could one day mean that we ll let in fewer

my observations and are admittedly lacking because i have not had an
opportunity to see all the teams the same amount anyway mvp most valuable player to his team both in terms of points and in terms of leadership can t win without him biggest surprise the player who rose above expectation the player that may have raised the level of his game to a new height even if that new level doesn t necessarily warrant an allstar berth includes those players who at the outset of the season may not even have been in the team s plans biggest disappointment the player from whom we expected more e g i picked denis savard in montreal because with the new emphasis on offence brought by demers shouldn t savard have done better"

they deserve and mvp can t win without him however i d suggest kelly
buchberger instead of dave manson who has had a brutal year his pick for
the all star game notwithstanding as for biggest surprise i d say that buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his breakthrough year for him last year so he didn t
really raise his game my suggestion would be shjon podein one of the
callups from cape breton during the year he was quite far down on the
depth chart in the oilers stable of prospects but made a big impact on
the team he has goals in his games and is only those are decent
numbers for a third line player who was seemingly doomed to minor league
oblivion the oilers coaching staff likens his style to john tonelli i think he ll be on the full time roster next year as for biggest disappointment you could name any of the players the oilers
dumped for lousy production this year nicholls gilchrist tikkanen or
even shayne corson but mellanby isn t far off"

wrap type material and vaseline is put on the goaltender s face then a
plaster is spread on their cheeks forehead and chin which takes about minutes to dry sufficiently when it dries it is effectively a mold of the
goalie s face this is used as the basis of the mask the rest involves

scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead
of taking the shot he found brind amour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa s body should have been a
goal but puppa made a great save reading the play garry galley gave the maple leafs th ranked power play the first chance when
he hooked doug gilmour at the flyers lowly st ranked penalty killing
unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the
maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept
away every rebound after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brind amour
gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the
net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef
beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to
get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into
the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for
a flyers lead at the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers
from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and
defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies
were strong bowen started giving some lindros like checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had
a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into
him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno
was a little far from the boards and mike mister mcgeough felt that it
warranted a boarding call at the leafs couldn t get anything going on the power play as the flyers were
very aggressive for a change on the kill with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone
and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf s blue line they were in
a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass
to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark
checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and
went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside
the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own
goalie at shots were flyers in the period the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk
tripped up rod brind amour in his offensive zone during the power play the
flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric
gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we
could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove
and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was
running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal
mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where
recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric one timed past puppa at with the assist recchi moves past
bobby clarke s season the second best one season total for a flyer at eric moves up to th all time in flyers rookie scoring with points mike eastwood took down al conroy at to give the flyers another chance on
the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with
a slash at not much happened on the on although the leafs had most
of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers
flared a little at bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton
got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a
hooking minor at to set up a on the replay showed that hawgood s
stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski
tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as
nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn t
get anything home shots were flyers the flyers were content with the goal lead in the third period and they
decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a
little the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first or so minutes of the
period but couldn t get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making
road kill out of them and tempers flared each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at on gilmour again the flyers smothered the leafs power play at about the minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left
circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on it s side and
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards
it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the
other seconds later rod brind amour tripped up gilmour at to give the
leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom
stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through
soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept
away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was
equal and preserved the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl
at no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski
baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at rouse and beranek
expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got each for slashing to
set up another on mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers
zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran
his stick across mcgill s face the flyers were not happy with that at all al conroy paired up with berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got
a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood cross check game clark carkner each berehowski
and conroy each fighting at so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest
in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brind amour played catch until
hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and
blasted it past puppa at that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa
did but kept the flyers off the board flyers shots were flyers in the rd probably the strongest game i ve seen from the flyers since the all star
break shutout number for soderstrom all since tied for nd most in
the nhl but he s played fewer games than belfour or the goalie i can t
remember that he s tied with next up it s the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers cannot
be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night
in washington would be the official end flyers up to points on the season in games last year they had points
in games under so they need at least points in their last games to improve on that only by percentage points under in is better
than under in tragic number holds at points with games left the tragic number for th
is points i watched the rangers blow a third period lead at home to
lose before i finished this up why points instead of well the flyers
will win the tie breaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie
breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble
down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and
finish up with games against the caps so i guess th place could be the

throws awarded after a certain number of fouls but it s
obviously easier to score in basketball there are more
opportunities if a basketball team scores points that s
at least fifty chances made the average number of shots taken
by each team in a hockey game and this is a total guess is
probably around and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe of them you have some good ideas concerning the other
penalties but i think that a player should be awarded a
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
interfered with also later in the post you talked about how boring the nba

surprise even though i personally do not really rate him well the biggest disappointment has to be carson though this is really unfair since too much was expected of him the second biggest disappointment is melrose with his adolescent handling of the goaltending problems putting hrudey on the bench for a month is just stupid it did not contribute to the team coming out of its slump mvp is surely robitaille dvb"

52651.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"my votes fwiw team mvp pat verbeek he fans on of goal mouth feeds but he still has goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary sp team captain
throughout a tough couple of seasons honorable mention nick kypreos and
mark janssens probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than
mvp but kypreos goals pim has been the hardest working player on
the team and janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker i guess
i place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value biggest surprise geoff sanderson he had goals and points last season
as a center then moved to left wing and has so far put up goals and points he now has a new whaler record power play goals most all coming
from the right wing faceoff circle his garden spot honorable mention andrew
cassels and terry yake the kiddie quartet of sanderson poulin nylander and
petrovicky have been attracting the most attention but cassels is just and will score close to points this season he has quite nicely assumed the
role of number one center on the team and works very well with sanderson yake
bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still and will put
up about goals and points this season yake like sanderson started
performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing although lefty sanderson went to the left wing and righty yake went to the
right side biggest disappointment hands down john cullen cullen had a disasterous point season last year his first full season after the trade cullen started
the season off of summer back surgery and fell flat on his face appropriate since he spent all of his whaler career flat on his ass and whining about it cullen scored just point on games was a clubhouse malcontent commanded
the powerplay to a success percentage with sanderson and sulked his
way out of town worst of all his year m contract had three years left
to run so no one would give up any more than the nd round draft pick the maple leafs offered to hartford honorable mention steve konroyd also subpar
after signing a year m contract eric weinrich who showed flashes of
competence but overall has played poorly jim mckenzie who was a much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he is now and frank pietrangelo who only
seemed to play well when sean burke was out for an extended period and he got

in kindersley saskatchewan or chelyabinsk russia if the gm believes him
to be the better player the gm should be drafting him where do you get off calling the nhl their league when referring to canadian
players it doesn t belong to them it belongs to the owners the owners
can do what they want while a canadian content rule might be enforcable
here in canada there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the us
that the cfl sorry for the football reference didn t even try to push their
import ratio rule on the sacromento goldminers increasing the competition for the elite positions in most cases would

that play in the ahl or the ihl where that s an nhl team s primary farm
club you don t hear of many europeans playing in the chl the echl or on

that the nhl could expand in europe would most of the north americans now playing in the nhl be willing

interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level i know i would but i am not a pro hockey player when one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes
me wonder how a european expansion could be achieved remember these lindros did not want to play in quebec for more than reasons nicholls in edmonton r courtnall wanted to be traded to la only c lemieux said he would refuse to go to edmonton earlier this year i know there are many non cultural reasons behind these but there is more some american players who played for the expos complained about the french fact and that the city was not quite like the other us cities one players wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in montreal anybody knows what happened when all these us football players moved

52662.eml,rec.sport.hockey,"of course penalties will have to be changed roughing chauvanistic males being aggressive slashing chauvanistic males venting frustration fighting proof that males cannot cope with their feelings no no no since all the penalties fall into three classes there should
only be three penalties foul any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your body or stick if you get you are out for the game unsportsmanlike contact an intentional foul this inlcludes all the current flavours of roughing fighting and boarding if you get two you are thrown out of the game and fined technical foul bad mouthing the ref by player or coach penalty shot is awarded two and you are thrown out of the game besides the penalty shot for one technical if the team gets penalties
in a period the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one until the end of the period the victim gets two shots if he she was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured this works well for several reasons first penalty shots are the most
exciting thing in hockey right so it follows that the more the better next when the player is setting up for a penalty shot the network can
take a commercial finally with only three penalties the network
announcers don meredith dick vitale john madden pat summerall and
marv levy among others will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
the pa announcer says it oh one other rule when a goal is scored times a period the play
cannot resume until the pa announcer announces it this way the network
can sneak in a few more commercials then once the pa announcer has told
them who scored the tv announcer can tell you the viewer and even have a chance of pronouncing his name right seriously though i actually went to see a nba basketball game last week for the first time in my life i was amazed how boring it was the play is
so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free throw shooting
contests during the period of course the laker girls get to do their routines at least times during the game and not just between periods
either there is a whistle every seconds on average maybe less the
game is minutes with minutes between quarters and and a minute halftime and it still takes over hours the reason for this has to be tv there is plenty of room to throw in
commercials and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening on tv basketball is fairly entertaining imho but it is better to watch
it on tv than to be there if this is the road the nhl is following then
it truly is a sad day enough for now dvb"

beat the devils on friday the will meet the caps in the playoffs however i have some more comments on the islanders and hockey in
general that i need to get off my chest first of all with the islanders back to back lackluster performances against the whalers one may think that the islanders are out of shape these guys always suck wind in the nd period come on a little in the rd and run out of gas too soon it is unbelieveable
how many one goal games these guys have lost anyway the games was pretty wide open the isles still have tons of trouble scoring the whalers played a golie in is st nhl start i think his name was lenarduzzi sp his nhl debut was the tuesday tie against the isles like i mentioned before this guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while until he misplayed a mahlakov slap shot to go to ot i say it s because the isles don t shoot correctly has anyone else noticed this also i think it is really a shame for hockey when i guy like mick
vukota gets as much ice time as he does this guy has about as much hockey
talent as jiggs macdonald who did play hockey i think anytime he gets the
puck it gets stolen and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties richard pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap and he s a
defenseman he s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus minus this guy gets beaten all the time why the need for such enforcers not
only do fights slow the game down alot but it takes away from the guys who are
really trying to play the game i ll be one of the few to admit i do enjoy a good fight once in a while but only when it s called for you know when a
guy checks the goalie too hard in other words a violation of hockey ethics might cause you to get puched but there is no need to start crap when you are
losing or becuase you can get away with it does anyone agree that referees
need to be a little less lenient in the rd and ot i mean come on already i m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down holding guys etc just becuase the
referee doesn t call it ot and late in the rd should be a time for strategy not physical prowess trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost if you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to
pull a guy down to prevent it you don t deserve to win in the first place just my honest opinion gary at hofstra"

of my favourites even though he s a damn bruin and the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours boston anyway but i think it will go six agreed here but montreal will be pushed to the limit is it just me or
does everything montreal does in the playoffs come down to roy go habs final i can t predict a montreal victory because i ve been watching them play for weeks and imo they severly need some tougher players especially to play
in the garden last time they beat the b s but boston had a clear
territorial advantage the victory was roy s at the same time i can t
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss so i ll just say i will
not be putting money on this series agreed ny doesn t have the goaltending to stop the onslaught independent
of the trouble they have given pittsburgh this year pens in five which is
credit to ny agreed here too but i think it will go at least six jersey has a decent
team and washington has done poorly against the division this year i think they will use tabaracci more after beaupre gets shelled i don t
think it will go six either maybe five if pittsburgh plays boston imo they win in likely five possibly six they
own the bruins if they play montreal i think it will go to seven and once
again i won t be putting money on the seventh game i say seven because the
habs have played pittsburgh very tough this season chicago will win but i think in at least six chicago is not that good imo and remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties very true the leafs have much to be proud of but they will soon find out
why montreal did so lousy in the playoffs toronto might win two or three at mlg though wings in six maybe even seven it will be a war possibly the most intense playoff series of them all and yes i think detroit will win probert will have to come up big though our first disagreement canucks are playing like shit they don t use their
size at all which may explain why they get hammered by a team
chasing them calgary winnipeg in six this is also tough for me to call because i haven t seen the smythe enough i don t think roberts will be well enough to figure in coffey is a
non issue who cares what carson has done before and never underestimate
gretzky la in six if it is these two calgary will not need six games but i think it will be
la winnipeg anyway and la in seven because of home ice wow must ve been tough to go against your team but let s see i picked
la detroit detroit will win probably in six if pittsburgh plays detroit it will go longer than five and i wouldn t bet
against the wings they are very strong imo and nobody knows how strong
because they ve been underachieving most of the year if forced to choose though i d have to take the penguins a side note vlad last week you said that selanne was a better player than
gilmour no way he is a more talented pure goal scorer but aside from
the age difference there is no way i would take him over gilmour on my team i m not asking for flames either btw i ve spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of selanne and i still say he s a great player but while
he and gilmour are both dangerous offensively give teemu an edge gilmour does it all i know a lot of gilmour bashing goes on esp from flame fans but imo you guys are letting your dislike of gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill he is easily one of the best

rather be playing golf don t really give a damn of course i can t say this
for sure but i believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and i
don t think that hockey players are above having what i consider typically
human attitudes with the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing money by participating in the playoffs the ones who regard the playoff take as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs now i know some of you are
going to come back with winning spirit and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all while they may love to play the game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose which is to make
a decent living of course the coach is a professional as well and part of what he is being paid to do is motivate the players so if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort the second season is after all merely an exhibition the true champions
of the league are the division winners the teams that come out on top after the long struggle of the season the stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and hot the emphasis on the playoffs with their sudden death appeal has been promoted

14987.eml,sci.crypt,"i hate to follow up to my own posting but i should perhaps clarify
some things so i won t get flamed first of all when i m talking about factoring the modulus or a breakthrough in factoring what i really mean is a breakthrough in
the cryptanalysis of rsa i know that factoring and breaking rsa are
not proven to be equivalent it s just so damn convenient not to
repeat this every time i also have to admit that i don t really know if the non group property of a cipher is essential only for key chaining i have
thought about it a little while but i can t find a way that a
cryptanalyst could exploit a group structure that of course means
nothing at all then i wrote what i meant was that as long as the only advantage of the
cryptanalyst is a faster computer then we will probably have rsa for
a long time to come because even if bit moduli somehow could be
broken with fast computers not with a new algorithm then people
would simply use longer moduli both users and cryptanalysts benefit
from better technology in the same way hope this keeps the flames away have fun"
14988.eml,sci.crypt,"after ibm had invented the des and the nbs had advertised for proposals but before ibm had decided to respond i argued strenuously that they should not they should keep it proprietary the biggest proponent of proposing was dr lewis branscomb dr branscomb
was the ibm chief scientist and had come to ibm from nbs fortunately
for all of us dr branscomb understood the answer to the above question
much better than i he realized how difficult it would be to gain
acceptance for any cryptographic mechanism because of the necessary
complexity publicity would not be sufficient and neither would authority in fact it has taken both of those plus more than years we have also had independence the des was solicited by nbs invented
and proposed by ibm and vetted by nbs it has also been examined and
vetted by experts like adi shamir who are not subject to influence by
any of these even now there are still people posting on this list who do not trust
the des in spite of all the time all of the analysis and all of the
public scrutiny of course it is just this point that nist misses when it attempts to gain acceptance for a novel mechanism developed in secret on the basis
of authority alone we had a long thread here about whether or not the nsa can break the
des that is a silly question at some cost and in some time they
can break anything the important question is at what cost and in
what time the fundamental strength of the des and rsa are not nearly so important
as what we know about their strength as long as we understand the
cost and duration for an attacker then we can use them in a safe way at this point we may never replace either because of the inability of
any successor to overcome this knowledge gap des and rsa are among the most significant inventions of the century

devices with built in trapdoors just like the feds wanted bla bla indeed and the current proposal does nothing to prevent the latter this doesn t say much there are many incredibly weak encryption
algorithms in commercial use today except from the government nope the criminals won t be stupid enough to use the new chip they ll use something secure this technology provides only means to
intercept the phone conversations of people who are stupid enough to
use it that is the government has the keys it doesn t matter much if they
are in one or in two of its hands correct it does however provide those americans with the false
sense of privacy if the screening is not public it cannot be trusted some people do
not trust des even today after all the examinations only because
some parts of its design were kept secret so they ll use a different technology to hide their illegal
activities so will those law abiding citizens who do not trust their
government not to misuse its abilities to decrypt their conversations except from the government huh later it says that the new technology will be export restricted in short the new technology can protect the law abiding citizen s privacy from the casual snooper it cannot protect him from the government if it decides to misuse its
ability to decrypt the conversations protect him from the criminals who succeed to break the new
encryption scheme or to steal the keys or to bribe the people who
handle them etc prevent the criminals from using secure encryption for
communication correct however it does not provide them that much privacy as it
claims two candidates the nsa and the mafia that is trust us security through obscurity if it s not entirely open to public examination it cannot be
trusted besides who can prove that the devices used for examination
and the ones built into your phones will be the same the nsa and the fbi why did they forget the academia doesn t this smell to monopolism like the mafia this is the main question why was it buried at the end we ll see trust us in short if we decide to outlaw strong crypto we ll tell you since the us government seems to consider strong crypto as munitions
and since the us constitutions guarantees the right to every american
to bear arms why is not every american entitled as a matter of
right to an unbreakable commercial encryption product bullshit the proposed technology provides a false sense of security encryption devices with built in capabilities for breaking the
encryption does not prevent the criminals to use strong crypto and
is a step to outlaw strong crypto who was the optimist who believed that the new administration will

15195.eml,sci.crypt,"april initial eff analysis of clinton privacy and security proposal the clinton administration today made a major announcement on
cryptography policy which will effect the privacy and security of
millions of americans the first part of the plan is to begin a
comprehensive inquiry into major communications privacy issues such as
export controls which have effectively denied most people easy access to
robust encryption and law enforcement issues posed by new technology however eff is very concerned that the administration has already
reached a conclusion on one critical part of the inquiry before any
public comment or discussion has been allowed apparently the
administration is going to use its leverage to get all telephone
equipment vendors to adopt a voice encryption standard developed by the
national security agency the so called clipper chip is an bit split key escrowed encryption scheme which will be built into chips
manufactured by a military contractor two separate escrow agents would
store users keys and be required to turn them over law enforcement upon
presentation of a valid warrant the encryption scheme used is to be
classified but the chips will be available to any manufacturer for
incorporation into its communications products this proposal raises a number of serious concerns first the administration has adopted a solution before conducting an
inquiry the nsa developed clipper chip may not be the most secure
product other vendors or developers may have better schemes furthermore we should not rely on the government as the sole source for
the clipper or any other chips rather independent chip manufacturers
should be able to produce chipsets based on open standards second an algorithm cannot be trusted unless it can be tested yet the
administration proposes to keep the chip algorithm classified eff
believes that any standard adopted ought to be public and open the
public will only have confidence in the security of a standard that is
open to independent expert scrutiny third while the use of the use of a split key dual escrowed system may
prove to be a reasonable balance between privacy and law enforcement
needs the details of this scheme must be explored publicly before it is
adopted what will give people confidence in the safety of their keys does disclosure of keys to a third party waive an individual s fifth
amendment rights in subsequent criminal inquiries these are but a few
of the many questions the administrations proposal raised but fails to
answer in sum the administration has shown great sensitivity to the importance
of these issues by planning a comprehensive inquiry into digital privacy
and security however the clipper chip solution ought to be
considered as part of the inquiry and not be adopted before the
discussion even begins details of the proposal escrow the bit key will be divided between two escrow agents each of whom
hold bits of each key the manufacturer of the communications device
would be required to register all keys with the two independent escrow
agents a key is tied to the device however not the person using it upon presentation of a valid court order the two escrow agents would
have to turn the key parts over to law enforcement agents according to
the presidential directive just issued the attorney general will be
asked to identify appropriate escrow agents some in the administration
have suggested that one non law enforcement federal agency perhaps the
federal reserve and one non governmental organization could be chosen but there is no agreement on the identity of the agents yet classified algorithm and the possibility of back doors the administration claims that there are no back doors means by which
the government or others could break the code without securing keys from
the escrow agents and that the president will be told there are no
back doors to this classified algorithm in order to prove this administration sources are interested in arranging for an all star crypto
cracker team to come in under a security arrangement and examine the
algorithm for trap doors the results of the investigation would then be
made public the clipper chipset was designed and is being produced and a sole source secret contract between the national security agency and two private
firms vlsi and mycotronx nsa work on this plan has been underway for
about four years the manufacturing contract was let months ago government as market driver in order to get a market moving and to show that the government believes
in the security of this system the feds will be the first big customers
for this product users will include the fbi secret service vp al
gore and maybe even the president at today s commerce department press
briefing a number of people asked this question though why would any
private organization or individual adopt a classified standard that had
no independent guaranty of security or freedom from trap doors comprehensive policy inquiry the administration has also announced that it is about to commence an
inquiry into all policy issues related to privacy protection encryption and law enforcement the items to be considered include export
controls on encryption technology and the fbi s digital telephony
proposal it appears that the this inquiry will be conducted by the
national security council unfortunately however the presidential
directive describing the inquiry is classified some public involvement

management the directive provides for the following advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption
are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of
communications and data by preventing unauthorized access advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to
rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications these advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the
infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the
information age despite its benefits new communications technology can also
frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance sophisticated
encryption can have this effect in the united states when
exported abroad it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence
activities critical to our national interests in the past it has
been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct
electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law
enforcement and national security interests while at the same time
protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens as
encryption technology improves doing so will require new innovative approaches in the area of communications encryption the u s government has
developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through
encryption that is substantially more robust than the current
government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed
to unlock the encryption the system for the escrowing of keys
will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information
only with appropriate legal authorization to assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect
and decrypt under legal authority electronically transmitted
information i hereby direct the following action to be taken installation of government developed microcircuits the attorney general of the united states or her representative shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which
incorporates encryption to install the u s government developed
key escrow microcircuits in their products the fact of law
enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from
the american public all appropriate steps shall be taken to
ensure that any existing or future versions of the key escrow
microcircuit are made widely available to u s communications
hardware manufacturers consistent with the need to ensure the

not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the
government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that
are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key escrow system key escrow the attorney general shall make all arrangements with appropriate
entities to hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits
installed in communications equipment in each case the key
holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent
unauthorized release of the keys the keys shall be released only
to government agencies that have established their authority to
acquire the content of those communications that have been
encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits the attorney
general shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which
an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such
communications procurement and use of encryption devices the secretary of commerce in consultation with other appropriate

facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted
with key escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems
that process sensitive but unclassified information i expect this
process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of
a final standard within six months of this directive the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to

15202.eml,sci.crypt,"though some may argue about the nose of the camel it s worth noting that
the government proposal is limited to scrambled telephony if it is only

easy to break inverters note that the big issue for the feds is the continued ability to wiretap before we go off the deep end with long discusions about secure crypto for
e mail and files let s focus on this one question that was not asked in the release is whether this proposal is
limited to telephony or if the government intends to expand it though i share many of the concerns expressed by some i find the proposal
less threatening than many others since right now most americans have no

15209.eml,sci.crypt,"hmmm check your facts good advice let s check mr cain s
facts a bit shall we fact it is unlawful to distribute code implementing rsa without a license
to do so from pkp whether or not one is charging for it furthermore any use of rsa other than for research purposes allowed under us patent
law is similarly unlawful therefore the average citizen cannot use
rsa to encrypt message traffic in the us without a license from pkp there is no licensed freely available product in the us that uses rsa
encryption other than rsaref and hence ripem at least as far as i am
aware if you know of another please post it here fact the last contact i had with rsa data security inc was with some
guy trying to sell me a license unsolicited i might add for tipem cost k plus percent royalties i suppose it is a matter of opinion as to whether or not these terms count
as mucho bucks or incredibly reasonable either way however this
definitely falls into the routines they tell you to use fact there are no restrictions yet on the use of cryptography under
us law although this is beginning to look like it will change the only
impediments to widespread use of rsa cryptography in the us are pkp s
patents mr cain please shut up until you get your facts straight better than the whole world be destroyed and crumble to dust than

15210.eml,sci.crypt,"i somehow started to doubt technical competence of the
people who designed the system why on the earth split the bit key in bit parts to keep them in escrow separately having bit and large volumes of data voice links produce
it should be relatively easy to break it when they simply
could keep bit sequences in n n independent places
and then xor all the partial keys to get the actual key n sequences should obviously be selected randomly and nth is the
actual key xor ed with the random sequences or is it a conspiracy vadim"
15211.eml,sci.crypt,"getting rid of the keys is actually pretty easy to do automatically on
a communications link as opposed to storage where the keys have to be
retained somehow as long as the owner wants to be able to retrieve the
data the right way to do communications security is to generate a random
session key with diffie hellman use it for a while and then destroy
it once it s gone there s no getting it back and no way to decrypt
recordings of the conversation to make sure you aren t being attacked by a man in the middle you
have to authenticate your dh exchanges the at t secure phone does
this by displaying the dh key so you can compare them verbally over
the phone this is nice and simple but it relies on user awareness
plus the inability of the man in the middle to duplicate the users voices a better way is to authenticate the exchanges with rsa since you d
never use rsa for actual encryption compromising your rsa secret key
would only allow someone to impersonate you in a future conversation and even that only until you revoke your public key they would still
not be able to decrypt recordings of prior conversations for which the
session keys have been destroyed i m convinced that this is how the government s own secure phones the stu iii must work neat eh phil"
15212.eml,sci.crypt,"okay let s suppose that the nsa nist mykotronix registered
key system becomes standard and i m able to buy such a system
from my local radio shack every phone comes with a built in
chip and the government has the key to every phone call i go and buy a phone and dutifully register the key what s to prevent me from swapping phones with a friend or buying a used phone at a garage sale whooa the secret registered
keys just became unsynchronized when the government comes to listen in they only receive gobbledly gook because the secret key registered under my name isn t the right one that leads me to conjecture that the system isn t that secure there are just two master keys
that work for all the phones in the country the part about
registering your keys is just bogus or the system is vulnerable to simple phone swapping attacks

15213.eml,sci.crypt,"quite interesting how does the us administration intend to persuade
non us governments to let the nsa eavesdrop on them or should u s companies install these chips in communication systems sold abroad
without the customer s knowedge or consent or not at all"
15214.eml,sci.crypt,"i was thinking about this also it s quite possible the
system transmits in clear the serial number of the device being
used that way they can start a tap get the serial number and use
the warrant for the first tap to get the key if they tap someone who s apparently using encryption but
don t find that prefix then they ll assume it s an un authorized encryption scheme"
15215.eml,sci.crypt,"as of yet there has been no description of the general principles
behind the clipper proposal for example is this a public key system
or a private key system if the latter then i don t see how the
system could work given that the keys are tied to the device and
not the person further the escrowed bit keys are split into two bit chunks i would guess that the availability of one of these bit chunks
and a reasonable key search machine would allow you to read the traffic i m not suggesting that this is a deliberate weakness of the system but it does make you think of course this is easily fixable by giving out two bit chunks which could be x ored to generate the real bit key philip"

not only give the people talking on the phone a false sense of security it will also give federal law enforcement agencies the justification
to deny use of strong encryption methods that are inconvenient to them dang it all it s supposed to be inconvenient but not impossible that s the only sure way to make sure that abuses are minimized while
still allowing legitimate law enforcement access uh huh sure i predict that within two months weeks of the chip s
debut the full technical details will be posted to sci crypt and if
this has any impact on the security of the key escrow system then we ve
been lied to any cryptosystem worth its salt can withstand the light
of public scrutiny and there is no way you can be sure that an

to ask for will owners be required to register their phones faxes modems etc and inform the government when they are moved to a different phone number will there be penalities if the public does not do this will identification the national health care id perhaps be required when purchasing a
clipper equipted phone or will each chip transmit identifying information at the start of
a conversation identification which could be used to automatically
log who calls whom the phone company keeps records but this information would be accessable by a well placed van near a microwave
relay station this raises the question of how the two phones agree on a communications

exchanged at the start of the conversation and hence derivable by
an eavesdropper"
15221.eml,sci.crypt,"the stragegy of the government is interesting the real fear comes from
them doing more than this this is a voluntary program and thus harder for us to object to on
the surface their strategy is a business one rather than legal one they are
pushing to get a standard in place a secret standard and if they
get it as a standard then they will drive competitors out of the market it will be legal to sell better untapable encryption that doesn t have
registered keys but it will be difficult and thus not a plan for
most phone companies you see with clipper chip phones you ll be able to talk to any
cellular company or other phones or ports because they will follow
the standard at t has already announced a clipper chip encryption
product the government has marketed hard to get major vendors to
use these chips if they get enough market share they will rule and thus there will be very little market for systems that can t be
tapped by the police the public isn t that concerned about it now after all they freely do calls that anybody with an old tv can listen
to today they won t pay big extra bucks for proprietary phones that secure
them only from the police well some people will buy these phones but they will only work with
other proprietary phones so the market will be small and the phones
expensive unless they are made in numbers large enough to sell them
cheap only the mob will buy them and this means that the fbi will want to track the customer lists of
better encryption phones because the only reason a person would want
one is to evade the police interesting"

15223.eml,sci.crypt,"i m quite astonished shocked and appalled at this serious frontal assault on emerging american freedoms the clinton administration nor any other government agency has any legitimate role whatsoever in regulating cryptography to do so is tantamount to regulating acceptable speech and is blatantly unconstitutional perhaps we should rename this year in honor of such an illustrious proposal let the crappy chip live in infamy and the adminstration
receive great shame and discredit for this bizarre misadventure i am outraged that my tax money is being used to develop technology
to restrict my freedoms far beyond reasonable measures the u s government will have my full uncooperation and disobedience on any
serious threat to my liberties such as this and i call on everyone
with an interest in a sensible government to resist and defy this proposal the administration does not seem to understand that they
are merely a subservient instrument to implement the will of the
public and hence anyone involved in this proposal in this respect is wholly negligent and remiss in performing their lawful duty it seems to me that u s diplomatic communications should be tappable by the u n whenever any countries produce a warrant to
the u n in fact i think we should stop paying the nsa billions
of dollars a year to produce unbreakable codes for this reason these actions violate the sovereignity of international law i hope
mr clinton is shrewd enough to recognize my sarcasm and satire here but if he isn t it s a modest and reasonable proposal so he should
find merit with it nevertheless cryptography is neutral technology if everybody has strong cryptography including policemen bureacrats businessmen housewives thugs and hoodlums we have a sustainable equilibrium anything less is an unworkable anti egaltarian arrangement intrinsically antithetical to american freedoms and
guaranteed to collapse under its own weight of inherent impracticality we don t need to compromise on issues of freedom for too long our government has demonstrated itself to be increasingly hostile and a serious obstacle to economic vitality and protecting americans it is not possible for the federal government
to act quickly or develop consistent comprehensive
policies period and even if by some grandiose miracle such
a thing were possible it would only be an efficient way to
deprive american citizens of fundamental and inalienable rights the administration has to be committed to leaving private industries alone esp on this issue the government has no legitimate role in regulating the content of communications law enforcement agencies must be prepared to forfeit their
surveillance bludgeon they are soon and inevitably to be disarmed of it no such laws can be constitutionally sound and this is equivalent
to a veiled threat which i don t appreciate this kind of extortion tends to agitate me and others into radicalism i will
trade threats for threats and violation for violation if the administration did say this it would find itself impeached for reckless and outrageous disregard of essential established entrenched and explicit constitutional privacy guarantees the administration would have no legal standing whatsoever such an action would be egregiously illegal and
criminal and wholly untolerated and disregarded by vast segments of the population the u s comprised of a vast majority of people fanatically committed to preserving their privacy in the face of an increasingly totalitarian government is saying just that take your chips and give them to nsa employees as christmas bonuses we can run any algorithm on our computers we damn well please and we will make any chips we please and we will send any bit pattern over our data highways we please and if you try to stop us you will be gradually or abruptly dissolved into nothingness privacy vs law enforcement this is an outright dingaling denning lie the two aims of
privacy and surveillance are intrinsically and fundamentally incompatible and you have to work for the nsa to think otherwise americans are about to discover ways through the use of technology to preserve their inalienable but forgotten freedoms that have slowly been eroded away by an increasingly distant and unresponsive and unrepresentative government"

15236.eml,sci.crypt,my thoughts on why the algorithm is secret the chip is regretably likely to become a standard there will be many applications where economic factors dictate use of this chip like it or not if the alrogithm is public and the code is as secure absent the access to escrowed keys as represented an enterprising sort would make compatible crypto chips for which no key had been escrowed this is likely what the release was refering to when they refered to the secrecy of the algorithm protecting the security of the escrow system rob boudrie

for cellular phones and encryption is only over the radio end not
end to end i think end to end will come later and of course you have to identify yourself to the phone company and

magic number of your chip when they sign out a warrant on you and
then can present the warrant to the key escrow house"

you get both halves of the encryption key from the two independent

current digital systems are very easy to decode right now anybody
with an old tv can hear them for most people this will be viewed
as an oh goody step upwards and look at how tolerant the public is they re willing to let the
neighbours with the radios hear right now it was suggested by one person that a lot of non evidentiary wiretapping
is going on right now without warrants because anybody can do it and it s
just an ecpa violation this would stop that all tapping would need
a warrant or a breach of security at the escrow houses"

houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure it s in the hands of cops and while i am sure most of the time they are
good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses what this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that
a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your
cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the
escrow houses do the police normally reveal every tap they do even if no charges are

every days contents in mathematical terms what is a private key cryptosystem what is an attack what s the advantage of formulating all this mathematically why is the one time pad secure what s a ciphertext only attack what s a known plaintext attack what s a chosen plaintext attack in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks what s a key guessing attack what s entropy in mathematical terms what is a private key cryptosystem a private key cryptosystem consists of an encryption system e and a decryption system d the encryption system e is a collection of functions e k indexed by keys k mapping some set of plaintexts p to some set of ciphertexts c similarly the decryption system d is a collection of functions d k such that d k e k p p for every plaintext p that is succesful decryption of ciphertext into plaintext is accomplished using the same key index as was used for the corresponding encryption of plaintext into ciphertext such systems wherein the same key value is used to encrypt and decrypt are also known as symmetric cryptoystems what is an attack in intuitive terms a passive attack on a cryptosystem is any method of starting with some information about plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts under some unknown key and figuring out more information about the plaintexts it s possible to state mathematically what this means here we go fix functions f g and h of n variables fix an encryption system e and fix a distribution of plaintexts and keys an attack on e using g assuming f giving h with probability p is an algorithm a with a pair f g of inputs and one output h such that there is probability p of computing h h p p n if we have f f p p n and g g e k p e k p n note that this probability depends on the distribution of the vector k p p n the attack is trivial or pointless if there is probability at least p of computing h h p p n if f f p p n and g g c c n here c c n range uniformly over the possible ciphertexts and have no particular relation to p p n in other words an attack is trivial if it doesn t actually use the encryptions e k p e k p n an attack is called one ciphertext if n two ciphertext if n and so on what s the advantage of formulating all this mathematically in basic cryptology you can never prove that a cryptosystem is secure read part we keep saying a strong cryptosystem must have this property but having this property is no guarantee that a cryptosystem is strong in contrast the purpose of mathematical cryptology is to precisely formulate and if possible prove the statement that a cryptosystem is strong we say for example that a cryptosystem is secure against all passive attacks if any nontrivial attack against the system as defined above is too slow to be practical if we can prove this statement then we have confidence that our cryptosystem will resist any passive cryptanalytic technique if we can reduce this statement to some well known unsolved problem then we still have confidence that the cryptosystem isn t easy to break other parts of cryptology are also amenable to mathematical definition again the point is to explicitly identify what assumptions we re making and prove that they produce the desired results we can figure out what it means for a particular cryptosystem to be used properly it just means that the assumptions are valid the same methodology is useful for cryptanalysis too the cryptanalyst can take advantage of incorrect assumptions often he can try to construct a proof of security for a system see where the proof fails and use these failures as the starting points for his analysis why is the one time pad secure by definition the one time pad is a cryptosystem where the plaintexts ciphertexts and keys are all strings say byte strings of some length m and e k p is just the sum let s say the exclusive or of k and p it is easy to prove mathematically that there are no nontrivial single ciphertext attacks on the one time pad assuming a uniform distribution of keys note that we don t have to assume a uniform distribution of plaintexts here s the proof let a be an attack i e an algorithm taking two inputs f g and producing one output h with some probability p that h h p whenever f f p and g g e k p i e g g k p then because the distribution of k is uniform and independent of p the distribution of k p must also be uniform and independent of p but also the distribution of c is uniform and independent of p hence there is probability exactly p that h h p whenever f f p and g g c over all p and c thus a fortiori a is trivial on the other hand the one time pad is not secure if a key k is used for more than one plaintext i e there are nontrivial multiple ciphertext attacks so to be properly used a key k must be thrown away after one encryption the key is also called a pad this explains the name one time pad what s a ciphertext only attack in the notation above a ciphertext only attack is one where f is constant given only some information g e k p e k p n about n ciphertexts the attack has to have some chance of producing some information h p p n about the plaintexts the attack is trivial if it has just as good a chance of producing h p p n when given g c c n for random c c n for example say g c c and say h p is the first bit of p we can easily write down an attack the guessing attack which simply guesses that h p is this attack is trivial because it doesn t use the ciphertext it has a fifty fifty chance of guessing correctly no matter what on the other hand there is an attack on rsa which produces one bit of information about p with success using c if it is fed a random c then the success rate drops to so this is a nontrivial attack what s a known plaintext attack the classic known plaintext attack has f p p p g c c c c and h p p depending only on p in other words given two ciphertexts c and c and one decryption p the known plaintext attack should produce information about the other decryption p note that known plaintext attacks are often defined in the literature as producing information about the key but this is pointless the cryptanalyst generally cares about the key only insofar as it lets him decrypt further messages what s a chosen plaintext attack a chosen plaintext attack is the first of an increasingly impractical series of active attacks on a cryptosystem attacks where the cryptanalyst feeds data to the encryptor these attacks don t fit into our model of passive attacks explained above anyway a chosen plaintext attack lets the cryptanalyst choose a plaintext and look at the corresponding ciphertext then repeat until he has figured out how to decrypt any message more absurd examples of this sort of attack are the chosen key attack and chosen system attack a much more important form of active attack is a message corruption attack where the attacker tries to change the ciphertext in such a way as to make a useful change in the plaintext there are many easy ways to throw kinks into all of these attacks for instance automatically encrypting any plaintext p as t e k h t r p r p where t is a time key sequence number chosen anew for each message r is a random number and h is a one way hash function here comma means concatenation and plus means exclusive or in mathematical terms what can you say about brute force attacks consider the following known plaintext attack we are given some plaintexts p p n and ciphertexts c c n we re also given a ciphertext c n we run through every key k when we find k such that e k p i c i for every i n we print d k c n if n is big enough that only one key works this attack will succeed on valid inputs all the time while it will produce correct results only once in a blue moon for random inputs thus this is a nontrivial attack its only problem is that it is very slow if there are many possible keys what s a key guessing attack what s entropy say somebody is using the one time pad but isn t choosing keys randomly and uniformly from all m bit messages as he was supposed to for our security proof in fact say he s known to prefer keys which are english words then a cryptanalyst can run through all english words as possible keys this attack will often succeed and it s much faster than a brute force search of the entire keyspace we can measure how bad a key distribution is by calculating its entropy this number e is the number of real bits of information of the key a cryptanalyst will typically happen across the key within e guesses e is defined as the sum of p k log p k where p k is the probability of key k"

encrypting my cd rom can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers what is the coding system used by vcr how do i recover from lost passwords in wordperfect wordperfect encryption has been shown to be very easy to break the method uses xor with two repeating key streams a typed password and a byte wide counter initialized to full descriptions are given in bennett ben and bergen and caelli ber decrypt wordperfect document files and i think i have a solution there is a software company named accessdata east south orem ut that has a software package that will decrypt any wordperfect lotus quatro pro ms excel and paradox files the cost of the package is steep prices but if you think your pw key is less than characters or char give them a call and ask for the free demo disk the demo disk will decrypt files that have a char or less pw key how do i break a vigenere repeated key cipher a repeated key cipher where the ciphertext is something like the plaintext xor keykeykeykey and so on is called a vigenere cipher if the key is not too long and the plaintext is in english do the following discover the length of the key by counting coincidences see gaines gai sinkov sin trying each displacement of the ciphertext against itself count those bytes which are equal if the two ciphertext portions have used the same key something over of the bytes will be equal if they have used different key then less than will be equal assuming random bit bytes of key covering normal ascii text the smallest displacement which indicates an equal key is the length of the repeated key shift the text by that length and xor it with itself this removes the key and leaves you with text xored with itself since english has about bit of real information per byte streams of text xored together has bits of info per bit byte providing plenty of redundancy for choosing a unique decryption and in fact one stream of text xored with itself has just bit per byte if the key is short it might be even easier to treat this as a standard polyalphabetic substitution all the old cryptanalysis texts show how to break those it s possible with those methods in the hands of an expert if there s only ten times as much text as key see for example gaines gai sinkov sin how do i send encrypted mail under unix pgp ripem pem here s one popular method using the des command cat file compress des private key uuencode mail meanwhile there is a de jure internet standard in the works called pem privacy enhanced mail it is described in rfcs through to join the pem mailing list contact there is a beta version of pem being tested at the time of this writing there are also two programs available in the public domain for encrypting mail pgp and ripem both are available by ftp each has its own newsgroup alt security pgp and alt security ripem each has its own faq as well pgp is most commonly used outside the usa since it uses the rsa algorithm without a license and rsa s patent is valid only or at least primarily in the usa ripem is most commonly used inside the usa since it uses the rsaref which is freely available within the usa but not available for shipment outside the usa since both programs use a secret key algorithm for encrypting the body of the message pgp used idea ripem uses des and rsa for encrypting the message key they should be able to interoperate freely although there have been repeated calls for each to understand the other s formats and algorithm choices no interoperation is available at this time as far as we know is the unix crypt command secure no see ree there is a program available called cbw crypt breaker s workbench which can be used to do ciphertext only attacks on files encrypted with crypt one source for cbw is ftpcb how do i use compression with encryption a number of people have proposed doing perfect compression followed by some simple encryption method e g xor with a repeated key unfortunately you can only compress perfectly if you know the exact distribution of possible inputs for all practical purposes it s impossible to describe the typical english text beyond coarse characteristics such as single letter frequencies you can build up more and more sophisticated models of your inputs but if the enemy has a slightly more accurate model he ll be able to find some redundancy in your compressed output note that nearly all practical compression schemes unless they have been designed with cryptography in mind produce output that actually starts off with high redundancy for example the output of unix compress begins with a well known three byte magic number that can serve as an entering wedge for cryptanalysis this is not to say that compression before encryption is inherently a bad idea it just has to be done very very carefully and by no means removes the need for strong encryption compression after encryption is silly is there an unbreakable cipher yes the one time pad is unbreakable see part unfortunately the one time pad requires secure distribution of as much key material as plaintext of course a cryptosystem need not be utterly unbreakable to be useful rather it needs to be strong enough to resist attacks by likely enemies for whatever length of time the data it protects is expected to remain valid what does random mean in cryptography cryptographic applications demand much more out of a pseudorandom number generator than most applications for a source of bits to be cryptographically random it must be computationally impossible to predict what the nth random bit will be given complete knowledge of the algorithm or hardware generating the stream and the sequence of th through n st bits for all n up to the lifetime of the source a software generator also known as pseudo random has the function of expanding a truly random seed to a longer string of apparently random bits this seed must be large enough not to be guessed by the opponent ideally it should also be truly random perhaps generated by a hardware random number source those who have sparcstation workstations could for example generate random numbers using the audio input device as a source of entropy by not connecting anything to it for example cat dev audio compress foo gives a file of high entropy not random but with much randomness in it one can then encrypt that file using part of itself as a key for example to convert that seed entropy into a pseudo random string when looking for hardware devices to provide this entropy it is important really to measure the entropy rather than just assume that because it looks complicated to a human it must be random for example disk operation completion times sound like they might be unpredictable to many people but a spinning disk is much like a clock and its output completion times are relatively low in entropy what is the unicity point a k a unicity distance see sha the unicity distance is an approximation to that amount of ciphertext such that the sum of the real information entropy in the corresponding source text and encryption key equals the number of ciphertext bits used ciphertexts significantly longer than this can be shown probably to have a unique decipherment this is used to back up a claim of the validity of a ciphertext only cryptanalysis ciphertexts significantly shorter than this are likely to have multiple equally valid decryptions and therefore to gain security from the opponent s difficulty choosing the correct one unicity distance like all statistical or information theoretic measures does not make deterministic predictions but rather gives probabilistic results namely the minimum amount of ciphertext for which it is likely that there is only a single intelligible plaintext corresponding to the ciphertext when all possible keys are tried for the decryption working cryptologists don t normally deal with unicity distance as such instead they directly determine the likelihood of events of interest let the unicity distance of a cipher be d characters if fewer than d ciphertext characters have been intercepted then there is not enough information to distinguish the real key from a set of possible keys des has a unicity distance of characters which is less than ciphertext blocks each block corresponds to ascii characters this may seem alarmingly low at first but the unicity distance gives no indication of the computational work required to find the key after approximately d characters have been intercepted in fact actual cryptanalysis seldom proceeds along the lines used in discussing unicity distance like other measures such as key size unicity distance is something that guarantees insecurity if it s too small but doesn t guarantee security if it s high few practical cryptosystems are absolutely impervious to analysis all manner of characteristics might serve as entering wedges to crack some cipher messages however similar information theoretic considerations are occasionally useful for example to determine a recommended key change interval for a particular cryptosystem cryptanalysts also employ a variety of statistical and information theoretic tests to help guide the analysis in the most promising directions unfortunately most literature on the application of information statistics to cryptanalysis remains classified even the seminal work of alan turing see koz for some insight into the possibilities see kul and goo what is key management and why is it important one of the fundamental axioms of cryptography is that the enemy is in full possession of the details of the general cryptographic system and lacks only the specific key data employed in the encryption of course one would assume that the cia does not make a habit of telling mossad about its cryptosystems but mossad probably finds out anyway repeated use of a finite amount of key provides redundancy that can eventually facilitate cryptanalytic progress thus especially in modern communication systems where vast amounts of information are transferred both parties must have not only a sound cryptosystem but also enough key material to cover the traffic key management refers to the distribution authentication and handling of keys a publicly accessible example of modern key management technology is the stu iii secure telephone unit which for classified use employs individual coded crypto ignition keys and a central key management center operated by nsa there is a hierarchy in that certain ciks are used by authorized cryptographic control personnel to validate the issuance of individual traffic keys and to perform installation maintenance functions such as the reporting of lost ciks this should give an inkling of the extent of the key management problem for public key systems there are several related issues many having to do with whom do you trust can i use pseudo random or chaotic numbers as a key stream chaotic equations and fractals produce an apparent randomness from relatively compact generators perhaps the simplest example is a linear congruential sequence one of the most popular types of random number generators where there is no obvious dependence between seeds and outputs unfortunately the graph of any such sequence will in a high enough dimension show up as a regular lattice mathematically this lattice corresponds to structure which is notoriously easy for cryptanalysts to exploit more complicated generators have more complicated structure which is why they make interesting pictures but a cryptographically strong sequence will have no computable structure at all see knu exercise ree and boy what is the correct frequency list for english letters there are three answers to this question each slightly deeper than the one before you can find the first answer in various books namely a frequency list computed directly from a certain sample of english text of course any such list will be correctly computed but exactly which list you get depends on which sample was taken the second answer is that the question doesn t make sense what do you mean by english letters the english language is not a fixed finite closed object that can be exactly characterized it has changed over time it is different between different authors any particular message will have different statistics from those of the language as a whole the third answer is that yes no particular message is going to have exactly the same characteristics as english in general but for all reasonable statistical uses these slight discrepancies won t matter in fact there s an entire field called bayesian statistics other buzzwords are maximum entropy methods and maximum likelihood estimation which studies questions like what s the chance that a text with these letter frequencies is in english and comes up with reasonably robust answers so make your own list from your own samples of english text it will be good enough for practical work if you use it properly what is the enigma for a project in data security we are looking for sources of information about the german enigma code and how it was broken by the british during wwii see wel dea koz hod kah how do i shuffle cards card shuffling is a special case of the permutation of an array of values using a random or pseudo random function all possible output permutations of this process should be equally likely to do this you need a random function modran x which will produce a uniformly distributed random integer in the interval x given that function you can shuffle with the following c code assuming arrlth is the length of array arr and swap interchanges values at the two addresses given for n arrlth n n swap arr modran n arr n modran x can not be achieved exactly with a simple ranno x since ranno s interval may not be divisible by x although in most cases the error will be very small to cover this case one can take ranno s modulus mod x call that number y and if ranno returns a value less than y go back and get another ranno value can i foil s w pirates by encrypting my cd rom someone will frequently express the desire to publish a cd rom with possibly multiple pieces of software perhaps with each encrypted separately and will want to use different keys for each user perhaps even good for only a limited period of time in order to avoid piracy as far as we know this is impossible since there is nothing in standard pc or workstation hardware which uniquely identifies the user at the keyboard if there were such an identification then the cd rom could be encrypted with a key based in part on the one sold to the user and in part on the unique identifier however in this case the cd rom is one of a kind and that defeats the intended purpose if the cd rom is to be encrypted once and then mass produced there must be a key or set of keys for that encryption produced at some stage in the process that key is useable with any copy of the cd rom s data the pirate needs only to isolate that key and sell it along with the illegal copy can you do automatic cryptanalysis of simple ciphers bruce schneier says accessdata of orem utah sells products

is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break what is cryptology cryptography plaintext ciphertext encryption key the story begins when julius caesar sent messages to his trusted acquaintances he didn t trust the messengers so he replaced every a by a c every b by a d and so on through the alphabet only someone who knew the shift by rule could decipher his messages a cryptosystem or cipher system is a method of disguising messages so that only certain people can see through the disguise cryptography is the art of creating and using cryptosystems cryptanalysis is the art of breaking cryptosystems seeing through the disguise even when you re not supposed to be able to cryptology is the study of both cryptography and cryptanalysis the original message is called a plaintext the disguised message is called a ciphertext encryption means any procedure to convert plaintext into ciphertext decryption means any procedure to convert ciphertext into plaintext a cryptosystem is usually a whole collection of algorithms the algorithms are labelled the labels are called keys for instance caesar probably used shift by n encryption for several different values of n it s natural to say that n is the key here the people who are supposed to be able to see through the disguise are called recipients other people are enemies opponents interlopers eavesdroppers or third parties what references can i start with to learn cryptology for an introduction to technical matter the survey articles given in part are the best place to begin as they are in general concise authored by competent people and well written however these articles are mostly concerned with cryptology as it has developed in the last years or so and are more abstract and mathematical than historical the codebreakers by kahn kah is encyclopedic in its history and technical detail of cryptology up to the mid s introductory cryptanalysis can be learned from gaines gai or sinkov sin this is recommended especially for people who want to devise their own encryption algorithms since it is a common mistake to try to make a system before knowing how to break one the selection of an algorithm for the des drew the attention of many public researchers to problems in cryptology consequently several textbooks and books to serve as texts have appeared the book of denning den gives a good introduction to a broad range of security including encryption algorithms database security access control and formal models of security similar comments apply to the books of price davies pri and pfleeger pfl the books of konheim kon and meyer matyas mey are quite technical books both konheim and meyer were directly involved in the development of des and both books give a thorough analysis of des konheim s book is quite mathematical with detailed analyses of many classical cryptosystems meyer and matyas concentrate on modern cryptographic methods especially pertaining to key management and the integration of security facilities into computer systems and networks the books of rueppel rue and koblitz kob concentrate on the application of number theory and algebra to cryptography how does one go about cryptanalysis classical cryptanalysis involves an interesting combination of analytical reasoning application of mathematical tools pattern finding patience determination and luck the best available textbooks on the subject are the military cryptanalytics series frie it is clear that proficiency in cryptanalysis is for the most part gained through the attempted solution of given systems such experience is considered so valuable that some of the cryptanalyses performed during wwii by the allies are still classified modern public key cryptanalysis may consist of factoring an integer or taking a discrete logarithm these are not the traditional fare of the cryptanalyst computational number theorists are some of the most successful cryptanalysts against public key systems what is a brute force search and what is its cryptographic relevance in a nutshell if f x y and you know y and can compute f you can find x by trying every possible x that s brute force search example say a cryptanalyst has found a plaintext and a corresponding ciphertext but doesn t know the key he can simply try encrypting the plaintext using each possible key until the ciphertext matches or decrypting the ciphertext to match the plaintext whichever is faster every well designed cryptosystem has such a large key space that this brute force search is impractical advances in technology sometimes change what is considered practical for example des which has been in use for over years now has or about possible keys a computation with this many operations was certainly unlikely for most users in the mid s the situation is very different today given the dramatic decrease in cost per processor operation massively parallel machines threaten the security of des against brute force search some scenarios are described by garron and outerbridge gar one phase of a more sophisticated cryptanalysis may involve a brute force search of some manageably small space of possibilities what are some properties satisfied by every strong cryptosystem the security of a strong system resides with the secrecy of the key rather than with an attempt to keep the algorithm itself secret a strong cryptosystem has a large keyspace as mentioned above the unicity distance is a measure which gives the minimum amount of ciphertext that must be intercepted to uniquely identify the key and if for some key the unicity distance is much longer than the amount of ciphertext you intend to encrypt under that key the system is probably strong a strong cryptosystem will certainly produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests see for example cae a strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous attacks a system which has never been subjected to scrutiny is suspect if a system passes all the tests mentioned above is it necessarily strong certainly not many weak cryptosystems looked good at first however sometimes it is possible to show that a cryptosystem is strong by mathematical proof if joe can break this system then he can also solve the well known difficult problem of factoring integers see part failing that it s a crap shoot if a cryptosystem is theoretically unbreakable then is it guaranteed analysis proof in practice cryptanalytic methods include what is known as practical cryptanalysis the enemy doesn t have to just stare at your ciphertext until he figures out the plaintext for instance he might assume cribs stretches of probable plaintext if the crib is correct then he might be able to deduce the key and then decipher the rest of the message or he might exploit isologs the same plaintext enciphered in several cryptosystems or several keys thus he might obtain solutions even when cryptanalytic theory says he doesn t have a chance sometimes cryptosystems malfunction or are misused the one time pad for example loses all security if it is used more than once even chosen plaintext attacks where the enemy somehow feeds plaintext into the encryptor until he can deduce the key have been employed see kah why are many people still using cryptosystems that are relatively easy to break some don t know any better often amateurs think they can design secure systems and are not aware of what an expert cryptanalyst could do and sometimes there is insufficient motivation for anybody to invest the work needed to crack a system"

15250.eml,sci.crypt,"it occurs to me that if they get a wiretap order on you and the escrow houses release your code to the cops your code is now no longer secure it s in the hands of cops and while i am sure most of the time they are good their security will not be as good as the escrow houses what this effectively means is that if they perform a wiretap on you at the end of the wiretap they should be obligated to inform you that a tap was performed and replace for free the clipper chip in your cellular phone so that it is once again a code known only to the escrow houses getting the court order to reveal the key also makes decipherable
all past conversations which may be on tape or disk or whatver as i understand the proposal i could be wrong but i ve seen no
mention of session keys being the escrowed entities as the eff noted this raises further issues about the fruits of one
bust leading to incrimination in other areas but is it any worse than the current unsecure system it becomes much
worse of course if the government then uses this clinton clipper to argue for restrictions on unapproved encryption this is the main
concern of most of us i think the camel s nose in the tent etc and it may also become much worse if the ostensible security is
increased thus allowing greater access to central office records by
the government the conversations being encrypted who will object to
letting the government have access to them perhaps even automatically
archiving large fractions this was one of the main objections to
the s proposal that it would force telecom suppliers to provide
easy access for the government one the government has had access to months or years of your encrypted
conversations now all it takes is one misstep one violation that
gets them the paperwork needed to decrypt all of them do we want anyone to have this kind of power tim may whose sig block may get him busted in the new regime"

every days contents what is a product cipher what makes a product cipher secure what are some group theoretic properties of product ciphers what can be proven about the security of a product cipher how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication what exactly is des what is triple des what is differential cryptanalysis how was nsa involved in the design of des is des available in software is des available in hardware can des be used to protect classified information what are ecb cbc cfb and ofb encryption what is a product cipher a product cipher is a block cipher that iterates several weak operations such as substitution transposition modular addition multiplication and linear transformation a block cipher just means a cipher that encrypts a block of data bytes say all at once then goes on to the next block the notion of product ciphers is due to shannon sha examples of modern product ciphers include lucifer sor des nbs sp networks kam loki bro feal shi pes lai khufu and khafre me a the so called feistel ciphers are a class of product ciphers which operate on one half of the ciphertext at each round and then swap the ciphertext halves after each round lucifer des loki and feal are examples of feistel ciphers the following table compares the main parameters of several product ciphers cipher block length key bits number of rounds lucifer des loki feal x x pes what makes a product cipher secure nobody knows how to prove mathematically that a product cipher is completely secure so in practice one begins by demonstrating that the cipher looks highly random for example the cipher must be nonlinear and it must produce ciphertext which functionally depends on every bit of the plaintext and the key meyer mey has shown that at least rounds of des are required to guarantee such a dependence in this sense a product cipher should act as a mixing function which combines the plaintext key and ciphertext in a complex nonlinear fashion the fixed per round substitutions of the product cipher are referred to as s boxes for example lucifer has s boxes and des has s boxes the nonlinearity of a product cipher reduces to a careful design of these s boxes a list of partial design criteria for the s boxes of des which apply to s boxes in general may be found in brown bro and brickell et al bri what are some group theoretic properties of product ciphers let e be a product cipher that maps n bit blocks to n bit blocks let e k x be the encryption of x under key k then for any fixed k the map sending x to e k x is a permutation of the set of n bit blocks denote this permutation by p k the set of all n bit permutations is called the symmetric group and is written s n the collection of all these permutations p k where k ranges over all possible keys is denoted e s n if e were a random mapping from plaintexts to ciphertexts then we would expect e s n to generate a large subset of s n coppersmith and grossman cop have shown that a very simple product cipher can generate the alternating group a n given a sufficient number of rounds the alternating group is half of the symmetric group it consists of all even permutations i e all permutations which can be written as an even number of swaps even and goldreich eve were able to extend these results to show that feistel ciphers can generate a n given a sufficient number of rounds the security of multiple encipherment also depends on the group theoretic properties of a cipher multiple encipherment is an extension over single encipherment if for keys k k there does not exist a third key k such that e k e k x e k x which indicates that encrypting twice with two independent keys k k is equal to a single encryption under the third key k if for every k k there exists a k such that eq is true then we say that e is a group this question of whether des is a group under this definition was extensively studied by sherman kaliski and rivest she in their paper they give strong evidence for the hypothesis that des is not a group in fact des is not a group cam what can be proven about the security of a product cipher recall from above that p k is a permutation produced by e under some key k the goal of the designer of e is to ensure that p k appears to be a random element of s n the symmetric group let r be an element of s n selected randomly we will say that p k and r are indistinguishable if an observer given p k and r in some order cannot distinguish between these two permutations in polynomial time that is with time bounded resources the observer cannot determine which of the permutations is produced by e the optimal decision is no better than simply guessing luby and rackoff lub have shown that a class of feistel ciphers are secure in this sense when the round mapping is replaced by random boolean functions how are block ciphers used to encrypt data longer than the block size there are four standard modes of operation and numerous non standard ones as well the standard modes of operation are defined in the u s department of commerce federal information processing standard fips published in see the question about ecb below for more details although they are defined for the des block cipher the modes of operation can be used with any block cipher can symmetric block ciphers be used for message authentication one may use a symmetric cryptosystem block cipher to prove to himself that he did or did not generate a message and to prove to himself whether his message was altered or unaltered since generation but one cannot prove these things to another without revealing the key and thereafter that key cannot be used to prove anything about any messages that were authenticated using that key see ansi x and fips for a standard method of message authentication using des what exactly is des des is the u s government s data encryption standard a product cipher that operates on bit blocks of data using a bit key it is defined in fips which supersedes fips fips are federal information processing standards published by ntis des is identical to the ansi standard data encryption algorithm dea defined in ansi x what is triple des triple des is a product cipher which like des operates on bit data blocks there are several forms each of which uses the des cipher times some forms use two bit keys some use three the des modes of operation may also be used with triple des some people refer to e k d k e k x as triple des this method is defined in chapter of the ansi standard x financial institution key management and is intended for use in encrypting des keys and ivs for automated key distribution its formal name is encryption and decryption of a single key by a key pair but it is referenced in other standards documents as ede that standard says section key encrypting keys may be a single dea key or a dea key pair key pairs shoud be used where additional security is needed e g the data protected by the key s has a long security life a key pair shall not be encrypted or decrypted using a single key others use the term triple des for e k d k e k x or e k e k e k x one of us carl ellison keeps advocating des triple use in the form e k tran e k tran e k compress x where each des instance has its own key and iv for cbc mode and tran has been posted on sci crypt it is a large block transposition program taking its key from the data stream itself so that it is not an encryption program on its own part what is differential cryptanalysis differential cryptanalysis is a statistical attack that can be applied to any iterated mapping ie any mapping which is based on a repeated round function the method was recently popularized by biham and shamir bih but coppersmith has remarked that the s boxes of des were optimized against this attack some years ago this method has proved effective against several product ciphers notably feal bi a differential cryptanalysis is based on observing a large number of ciphertexts y y whose corresponding plaintexts x x satisfy a known difference d x x where is componentwise xor in the basic biham shamir attack such plaintext pairs are required to determine the key for des substantially fewer pairs are required if des is truncated to or rounds in these cases the actual key can be recovered in a matter of minutes using a few thousand pairs for full des this attack is impractical because it requires so many known plaintexts the work of biham and shamir on des revealed several startling observations on the algorithm most importantly if the key schedule was removed from des and a bit key was used the key could be recovered in less than steps thus independent subkeys do not add substantial security to des further the s boxes of des are extremely sensitive in that changing even single entries in these tables yields significant improvement in the differential attack adi shamir is quoted to say nytimes oct i would say that contrary to what some people believe there is no evidence of tampering with the des so that the basic design was weakened how was nsa involved in the design of des according to kinnucan kin tuchman a member of the group that developed des at ibm is quoted as saying we developed the des algorithm entirely within ibm using ibmers the nsa did not dictate a single wire tuchman and meyer another developer of des spent a year breaking ciphers and finding weaknesses in lucifer they then spent two years strengthening lucifer their basic approach was to look for strong substitution permutation and key scheduling functions ibm has classified the notes containing the selection criteria at the request of the nsa the nsa told us we had inadvertently reinvented some of the deep secrets it uses to make its own algorithms explains tuchman on the other hand a document called involvement of the nsa in the development of des unclassified summary of the united states select committee on intelligence printed in the ieee communications magazine p states in the development of des nsa convinced ibm that a reduced keysize was sufficient indirectly assisted in the development of the s box structures and certified that the final des algorithm was to the best of their knowledge free from any statistical or mathematical weakness clearly the key size was reduced at the insistence of the nsa the article further states that the nsa did not tamper with the algorithm itself just the parameters which in some sense resolves the apparent conflict in the remarks of meyer and tuchman presented above is des available in software several people have made des code available via ftp see part for pathnames stig ostholm ftpso bsd ftpbk eric young ftpey dennis furguson ftpdf mark riordan ftpmr phil karn ftppk a pascal listing of des is also given in patterson pat fips says the algorithm specified in this standard is to be implemented using hardware not software technology software implementations in general purpose computers are not in compliance with this standard despite this software implementations abound and are

it was given its charter by president truman in the late s and has continued research in cryptology till the present the nsa is known to be the largest employer of mathematicians in the world and is also the largest purchaser of computer hardware in the world governments in general have always been prime employers of cryptologists the nsa probably possesses cryptographic expertise many years ahead of the public state of the art and can undoubtedly break many of the systems used in practice but for reasons of national security almost all information about the nsa is classified bamford s book bamfd gives a history of the people and operations of the nsa the following quote from massey mas highlights the difference between public and private research in cryptography if one regards cryptology as the prerogative of government one accepts that most cryptologic research will be conducted behind closed doors without doubt the number of workers engaged today in such secret research in cryptology far exceeds that of those engaged in open research in cryptology for only about years has there in fact been widespread open research in cryptology there have been and will continue to be conflicts between these two research communities open research is common quest for knowledge that depends for its vitality on the open exchange of ideas via conference presentations and publications in scholarly journals but can a government agency charged with responsibilities of breaking the ciphers of other nations countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break can a researcher in good conscience publish such a cipher that might undermine the effectiveness of his own government s code breakers one might argue that publication of a provably secure cipher would force all governments to behave like stimson s gentlemen but one must be aware that open research in cryptography is fraught with political and ethical considerations of a severity than in most scientific fields the wonder is not that some conflicts have occurred between government agencies and open researchers in cryptology but rather that these conflicts at least those of which we are aware have been so few and so mild what are the us export regulations in a nutshell there are two government agencies which control export of encryption software one is the bureau of export administration bxa in the department of commerce authorized by the export administration regulations ear another is the office of defense trade controls dtc in the state department authorized by the international traffic in arms regulations itar as a rule of thumb bxa which works with cocom has less stringent requirements but dtc which takes orders from nsa wants to see everything first and can refuse to transfer jurisdiction to bxa the newsgroup misc legal computing carries many interesting discussions on the laws surrounding cryptographic export what people think about those laws and many

are the beale ciphers and are they a hoax thanks to jim gillogly for this information and john king for corrections the story in a pamphlet by j b ward goes thomas jefferson beale and a party of

15263.eml,sci.crypt,"fascinating most of the content of the white house announcements was
in what was not said it gives us almost nothing of value threatens to
take away a lot and does it with a sincere smile on its face and the nice friendly word management fact sheet public encryption management the first thing it doesn t say is we re giving you stronger encryption what it says is the u s government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption the system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization but des is strong enough that only the government can break it now so the major effect is to make it easier for government to break at best it makes it more difficult for the nsa to break since they
need to get one of the two escrowed keys to do a brute force search
for the other bit key similarly it didn t say we re making encryption is commercially available because encryption is already commercially available including
forms the nsa may not be able to break like triple des or idea and phone companies could offer des based systems now if they were
convinced the government would let them and they could make enough money the next thing it didn t say is we re making encryption legal because of course encryption has always been legal and the
president can t change the first amendment merely by decree what it did say was in making this decision i do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key escrow system which clearly means we re making encryption illegal unless we get your keys soon once business buys into this another thing it didn t say is we re going to ask congress for money
to do lots more wiretapping because of course there s a budget crisis and congress might debate the policy issues or not give them the cash what it did say was the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government s ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications further the attorney general shall utilize funds from the department of justice asset forfeiture super surplus fund to effect this purchase which means we ve got money congress can t control and we re going to
buy lots of wiretapping equipment with it to detect non approved crypto that s what preserve the government s ability to conduct surveillance means"
15264.eml,sci.crypt,"interestingly enough in designing the escrow we may want to use some
rather unusual technology such as sealed boxes of paper or
destructive read memory rather than typical computer databases which
is fun for a database of hundreds of millions of keys the greatest danger of the escrow database if it were kept on disk would be the chance that a complete copy could somehow leak out you
can design lots of protection but with enough corruption a complete
copy is always possible storing it on paper or something very hard
to copy at once may actually make sense or a medium that can t be
copied for example something with very slow access times or which
leaves a destructive trail if it is even read of course then it s hard to backup however i think the consequences
of no backup the data is not there when a warrant comes are worse
than the consequences of a secret backup an audit trail that reveals when data has been access that can t be
erased by the humans involved is also necessary"

15281.eml,sci.crypt,"a unix tool of cryptographic significance is available
for anonymous ftp agrep a fast approximate pattern matching tool source code project available from cs arizona edu in directory agrep agrep is a very fast fuzzy search tool with a tremendous
number of powerful search options the one most obviously
applicable to cryptography key selection is to be able to
specify the similarity of matches in the data for example say you make up a password phrase of qimwe l of course you rightly suspect that this key itself is not
in any dictionary or word list but how close is it to
en entry that could be varied by some crack program to
brute force search for it you use agrep to find out looking with argument for none one or two errors no matches good so far but agrep qimwe l bigwordandphraselist finds that the pattern qimwe l is too close to the
pattern imsel part of himself and a host of others to be of any cryptographic value as a key an error of level two corresponds to a simple transposition of
letters like teh for the a minimally acceptable password
would have to pass as least level in order not immediately
ruled out as even a remote possibility of being a good password in real cryptographic use my personal passphrases clear at least level on my rather large meg word and phrase lists and for searching for key words in human typed data lots o typos the tool is unexcelled for example for example say i want to find out what people think about gibson s
sf book neuromancer in the huge sf lover s archives even with an error distance specification as small as
of i will find all those people who think the title
was necromancer or other common typos why miss anything also the program can look for up to patterns in parallel
at boyer moore sublinear speeds great for a nsa wannabe
to look for your name terrorists names special tagalog or
religious words etc in the news or e mail spool directories you can even search for ciphertext by using say random three byte combinations and eliminate all texts that
don t score the x chi square birthday hits on message size y you think some crypto terrorist is try to foil you by changing
the pattern on you no problem try agrep p nsa to find
nsa national security agency nsecag no such agency national scrabble association n s a etc you can also specify fixed areas looking for license
plate xyz when you know that the letters are correct you might say agrep licenseplatedatabase will find all plates starting with xyz with up to two errors addition substitution deletion in the number area you can
also weight the relative cost for substiutions additions or deletion errors for example when searching dna patterns
for a particular protein combination you might know that
some kinds of damage cause the a nucelotide to drop out more
than other errors you could adjust for this bias by setting dc where you set the deletion cost to count as c errors a steganographic use i even used agrep eograp e just now to find the correct spelling would be to intentionally
introduce errors of a certain type and magnitude into a plaintext
and then later recover the orginal it via an agrep pipe lots of
possibilities here when only outlaws can have ciphertext also with agrep s powerful extraction options it makes it easy
to abstract the hits into a useful form for example agrep d from pgp passphrase zimmerman nsa says output the entire mail record delimited by from that contains pgp and contains either passphrase zimmerman or nsa and agrep has been measured an order of magnitude faster
than the second best similarity tool publicly available as usual i will be glad to e mail the source and docs

that went on ad infinitum last time that s especially true for
sci crypt for that matter i ve created alt privacy clipper since
the traffic is appearing in many different groups right now i m going to focus here on some technical aspects of the plan hence my
followup to sci crypt frankly if you re not an absolutist your
feelings may turn on some of these issues for example with an bit key simply splitting it into two bit pieces is much less
acceptable than other schemes because it means that if just one
repository is shall we say overly pliable a would be eavesdropper
would need to recover just more bits of key i need not point out
in this newsgroup that that s pretty easy to do by exhaustive search a slightly more complex scheme xor ing the key with a random number and then with its complement would produce two bit subkeys neither of which is useful alone that variant is much more resistant
to attack clearly one can get even more sophisticated to protect
the subkeys even more other thoughts some people have noted the size and complexity of
the databases necessary but the id strings the phones emit could be
their back door key double encrypted with the escrow repositories public keys for that matter they could do that only with session
keys and have no back door at all in that case the fbi would have
to bring every intercept to the repositories to be decrypted this
would answer many of the objections along the lines of how do you
make sure they stop we can even combine that with a variant of the digital telephony back
door have the switch do the tap but with a digitally signed record
of the time phone number etc of the call that provides proof to
the escrow agents that the tap was done in compliance with the terms of
the warrant i can suggest other variations too suppose each clipper chip had public key pairs each would be used times after which you d need
more keying material not a bad idea in any event this could be
used to enforce time limits or rather usage limits on each warrant the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn t last for very
long i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure apart from
the obvious why push a weak algorithm when you ve already got the
back door i think that the government is still genuinely concerned
about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial targets this
scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it too i ve heard
rumors over the years that some factions within nsa were unhappy with
des because it was too good not that they couldn t crack it but it
was much too expensive to do so as easily as they d want they re keeping
the details secret so that others don t build their own implementations
without the back door the cryptographic protocol though is another matter i see no valid
reasons for keeping it secret and as i hope i ve shown above there
are a lot of ways to do things that aren t quite as bad"
15285.eml,sci.crypt,"this announcement is somewhat disconcerting it doesn t do anything
evil in and of itself but bodes badly for the future of open

i m a little anxious no doubt it won t be long before someone posts
explaining how this just a small part of some far ranging and
long lived nsa pkp irs fbi cia handguncontrolinc clinton conspiracy to
subvert freedom democracy and mathematics my feeling is that the
administration probably isn t that worried about things like des and
rsa and pgp and ripem since they ll never be used by a group much
wider than us computer geeks the fact that this just came out now suggests one of two things the nsa has been working on this for a long time and it only just now happened to be ready to release to the world at this time the nsa has been working on this for a long time but wasn t able to get the bush administration to go along with this plan i find it unlikely that this would have been because of a sympathy for the unescrowed use of cryptography more likely the administration felt that even escrowed secret algorithm and for all we know trivially breakable cryptography should not be made widely available thus said clipper chip announcement the majority of the discussion involving this clipper chip seems to
pertain to the encryption of telephone conversations does anyone
know if that means this chip is designed to work primarily with analog
signals the language sort of suggests this but it s hard to say the main thing i just don t get is whether this chip implements
symmetric or asymmetric cryptographic techniques anybody know i m guessing symmetric but they don t get very clear about it if it
is symmetric how is it useful for anything other than link level
encryption with an identical chip at each end how can you negotiate
a per session key using symmetric cryptography without using a trusted
third party who knows your key or does it even use a per session
key if it s asymmetric what about pkp s patents which they claim cover
all methods of doing asymmetric cryptography are they getting
royalties or is hiding infringement the real reason for keeping the
algorithm secret"

where you can cheaply change keys des has inherent security advantages regardless of the algorithms involved"
15287.eml,sci.crypt,"from the limited details released so far it seems that the clipper chip system must employ some sort of public key cryptography otherwise the key management problems inherent to symetric ciphers would make the system unworkable it probably has some sort of public key exchange that takes place
at the start of each call thats how they would identify the private key in their data base this means that either the nsa has developed some non rsa public key algorythm or the feds have decided to subsidize pkp rsadsi the former is rather an exciting posibility since keeping the algorythm secret while making
chip implimentations widely avalibe will be exceptionally hard if the feds
are forced to make it avalible in order to gain public acceptance than that could break rsa s stranglehold on public key crypto in the u s as for my impressions of the whole scheme it seems that instead of trying to
ban strong crypto they are trying to co opt it their contention that they need to keep the algorythm secret to protect the security of the key
registration suggests possible inherent weakness to the algorythm more likely
is that they dont want anyone constructing black market devices which dont have the keys registered anyone else notice that in their q a session they
talk about releasing the keys only to people with proper autiorization but
carefully dance around stating that the keys will simply have to be supeonaed they seem to be trying to keep open the posibility of obtaining keys without court order even though tapping a phone line requires one also pick up on their implicit threat of eithe accept this or we ll ban strong crypto outright i dont trust this plan at all and plan to oppose it in all legal ways

52735.eml,sci.electronics,"thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a
couple of the ideas i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil spec version of exar s xr timer counter chip it is stable down to c
and sucks very little power they show an application for a ultra long time
delay up to several years depending on the rc time constant in this
application they have two of them cascaded together the reset and trigger
pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is
disabled in this configuration the output is high when the system is reset when triggered the output goes low and stays that way for a total of x
the timing cycle of the first chip the total timing cycle of the two chips can
be programmed from to x r x c to x r x c in steps by selecting
any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output the beauty of it
is the timebase chip would only have to have a uf timing cap and a k
resistor for seconds per timing cycle so i can get a maximum of seconds between timing cycles x or about days of course that s much more than i need days but the counter allows for binary steps that can be selected for the output for the pellet puker after the first days and it trips it would reset its self for the next day timing cycle and so forth power is still a problem though a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the
electronics in a hole dug in the snow as an insulator and put the pellet
puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to
keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea this thing has to
work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are volts

a hard time being convinced that their scopes match the rest of their excellent gear one of the principal functions i look for when considering a dso is
whether you can turn interpolation off the other important feature
is to disable repetitive waveform acquisition i e being able to lock
the instrument into real time capture mode i agree with you here the only consolation is that manufacturers are beginning to pay attention to ergonomics when designing the menus however to be fair it seems that first time scope users our students seem to adjust to menus easier than navigating around the twenty or
more knobs required of a real scope this is one area that newer dsos are addressing i recently evaluated
the latest box from tek their tds which seems to be a worthy
alternative to a standard mhz analogue cro this instrument has
a mhz ms s spec meaning that it is always in real time
capture mode the pricing also matches equivalent analogue scopes in
the range the downer is that the instrument uses menus again but at
least they appear to be logically laid out one more thing about the new simpler front panels these instruments
tend to use digital rotary encoders as knobs now this is a vast improvement

will have been designed as a ram battery substitute rather than for use in
applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current their
performance in some respects is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap the other point is that big electro s are usually rated with tolerances so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering
the cold you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain that rolls over from zero to maximum count or vice versa once every seconds if you were to use something like a hz clock you would
need a divider chain of to give an error of less than one percent in the
firing times over the six week period of course you could trim the hz
oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator
remaining exactly constant at is low anyway i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the

any ratio is the reference unit used sometimes this will be a reference
power such as milliwatt given a certain circuit impedance which
should also be included in the fine print or known like ohms
in an rf circuit of that impedance leading to an accepted
notation of dbm maybe it might be dbv disregarding the impedance of
the circuit and power developed using volt as reference amplitude rather than reference power or it might have an arbitrary or omitted
reference that is not included in the notation leading to just plain db so look at it this way db has an implied reference while notation
such as dbm has an explicit reference for power db log p measured p reference for amplitude db log a measured a reference b is for bel which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base named after alexander graham bell a deci bel is of a bel it has nothing to do with the bell telephone company except for
the common founder s name the small d large b is per si notation
convention i don t know anyone that s been crucified for messing it up common references for audio are dbm milliwatt across ohms dbv volt vu a zero on the vu meter dbm pro gear line level vu dbv consumer gear line level often times a power amp vu meter will be aligned using
the rated power of the amp as the db point it is all
done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application

increase the rc constant and hence alleviate some of the problem these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need of

some of the functions are typically presented in my opinion in a counter intuitive fashion hp has made some strides in their series imo automatic setups are fine for simple repetitive waveforms but can give you some crazy results on more
complex events where you need to understand how the scope is
actually measuring processing the event for example is the scope
in equivalent time or in real time sampling mode equivalent time
being a mode where samples are built up slowly by adding a delay to
the trigger event each sweep what was the scope s actual sampling
rate at the time how is the data being massaged after capture but
before display etc one common misconception is the speed of the scope is the hp scope you re using really a mhz scope or is it a mhz
sample rate scope mhz single shot significance whose front
end including s h can support mhz waveforms important for
equivalent time sampling the mhz input in this case really
only helps you when your waveform is repetitive or on a single
sample when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time so there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get
useful information from a digital scope i prefer an analog scope for
general use and the digital for events where i need storage for
later analysis or comparison when the event is within the capability
of the scope now for the price of true mhz digital scopes to
fall"

think a temperature difference can give you an emf as well anyway it struck me that you could make a nice cool hot box for

couple of heat sinks the biggest device can shift w with an
efficiency of which ain t bad although it would flatten my
car battery in about half an hour unfortunately the catalogue didn t list anything more than the basic
specs as a heat pump i imagine that you would get a back emf as the
temperature gradient across the device increases if so presumably
its power decreases as the back emf increases until eventually we
have a steady state with no current being consumed assuming no
leakage if so then the final temperature difference between the
two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it what i would like to know is are the above guesses correct what is the open circuit thermal resistance of a typical device i just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm too fast when i unplug it how does a peltier effect heat pump actually work it looks like magic why don t they use these things in domestic fridges freezers thanks in advance paul paul johnson tel ext these ideas and others like them can be had gec marconi research is not

output transistor s or if there is one the voltage regulator the most

negative which is the normal situation real internists
can talk for hours about clubbing i m limited to a couple
of minutes whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is
entirely unclear but it is one of those things that internists
love to paw over during rounds supposedly only true clubbing
is associated with disease the problem is that the list of
diseases associated with clubbing is quite long and includes
both congenital conditions and acquired disease since many of
these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems
leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia it is
very reasonable to get a chest xray however many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac
catheterization the cause of clubbing is unclear but presumably relates to
some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to
dilate abnormally clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is
a tipoff to do more extensive examination often however the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent km"

58109.eml,sci.med,"i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly motrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but had
forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here i generally don t take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because i ve
found them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sources
that force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is some
pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then much
worse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably due
to the endometriosis coming back i ve tried synarel it reduced
the pain while i took it mos but the pain returned immediately
after i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the
only real solution to my problem although i don t expect to have
any more children i don t like the idea of having my uterus and
one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i had
the surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggested
i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks
that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan
to have children so basically all i m left with is toughing out
the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or something
similar but not aspirin that doesn t work and motrin gave me
horrible gastritis a few years ago so i m through with it in
fact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take
it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as i ll discuss in a moment generally though i wait until
i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takes
several hours for it reduce the pain it s actually quite effective
at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantime
i m frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in
bilateral radiculopathy i ve had mris xrays ct scan and emgs i ve had of them and don t intend to ever do that again with
nerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as to
what is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i have
several bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i think it is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan
was that there are two herniations l l and l l but others
hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation
compared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible test called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is that
i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back pain
is there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is there i need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain
to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so i d always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physical
therapy for the last months times a week after the first month
or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at
a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began going
away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which
could be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i don t have
nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off
traction about weeks ago getting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoid
taking analgesic for headaches i really can t avoid them entirely because
i have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgot
to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery but i m avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at
a reduced capacity i m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading
and writing when the pelvic pain is bad i can t concentrate much i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because
the pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it can
cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric
shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad
i can t really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home
and in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the
migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lot
of migraines an average of to a month which last days i ve taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so
i reduced the dosage but i don t like the side effects if i take
more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will
eventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasn t very helpful when
i told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan
becomes available i should try that i ve tried several other medications fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but
they either didn t work or i couldn t tolerate them so what can i do my doctor s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the
pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of
pain i ve had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped
once from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely the
succinylcholine and i ve already had surgery several times anyway the point of what i m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute
to migraines some people need to take them to tolerate other pain janice rathmann"

reiterate cones respond to particular portions of the spectrum just
as rods respond to certain parts of the visible spectrum bluegreen

specificity with being color sensitive however the two are not
synonymous so in sum and to beat a dead horse when the outputs of a cone are matched for number of
absorbed photons irrespective of the absorbed photons wavelength the cone outputs are indistinguishable cones are simply detectors with different spectral
sensitivities and are not any more color sensitive than are rods ommatidia or other photoreceptors color vision arises because outputs of receptors which

found in any grocery store most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store what is important is how they are used and what else is excluded during their use the day fast st day eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes nd day eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including garlic also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings rd day drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want preferably start with to ounces of prune juice with pulp followed by a gallon of pure not from concentrate apple juice then grape juice stay close to your home bathroom th day eat all the un salted nuts no peanuts and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds almonds contain laetrile th day one gallon of lemonade squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water preferably distilled and add to tablespoons of locally made honey no sugar drink one glass per hour everyone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp th day same as th day th day same as th day all days eat only the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much distilled water as you want the grape diet eat to ounces of fresh grapes every hours am to pm every day for six days eat nothing else during the six days but drink as much distilled water as you want apple cider vinegar mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar not apple cider flavored vinegar regular vinegar is harmful in a glass of water preferably distilled and drink all of it do this or times per day for weeks then stop for a week repeat if desired do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods this remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a fungus as well as against other kinds of fungus infections the sea salt soda bath please keep an open mind fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely dissolve in the bath water pound of sun evaporated sea salt regular salt won t work and pound of fresh baking soda soak in this bath for to minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc among other things the sea salt soda bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of x rays etc as described in the book born to be magnetic vol by frances nixon precautions only the one person using each bath should prepare it and drain it for at least minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people your greatly expanded aura energy field during that time could disrupt other people s fields two hours after the bath eat at least ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures the bath may kill friendly bacteria also better yet take a billion bacteria acidophilus capsule which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of a i d s because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system because this external bath can kill in ternal bacteria it may also be a cure for lyme disease do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within days of a full moon nor during major or minor periods as listed in the solunar tables published bimonthly in field stream magazine because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy fields present at those times do not take this bath more than four times per year miscellaneous natural anti cancer remedies for skin cancer apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily and take to tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally for about months d m s o dimethyl sulfoxide causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions almonds un blanched un roasted contain laetrile to help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day to help cure cancer eat several ounces of almonds per day never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally it will kill you take it intravenously only cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell this enzyme is also present in the digestive system anti oxidants are free radical scavengers and include vitamin e selenium mcg per day is safe for most people chromium up to mcg per day vitamin a iu per day is safe for most people superoxide dismutase up to units per day vitamin c up to mg per day and bht butylated hydroxy toluene to capsules of bht every night at bedtime will also make one immune against herpes both types suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes bht might also do these things against a i d s which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia see the book life extension by durk pearson and sandy shaw hydrogen peroxide dilute twelve drops of hydrogen peroxide in a glass of pure water preferably distilled and drink it do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else apply hydrogen peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day use hydrogen peroxide only if you are taking a

diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems some radionics psionics machines can even take cross sectional x ray like photos of cancer tumors etc with out x rays interferon tablets taheebo tea lapacho homeopathy can cure cancer and many other medical problems even drug addiction mg per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble this list is not exhaustive the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un diagnosed cancers as well as prevent them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart diseases they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially the day fast and the grape diet send a strong message to one s subconscious mind programming it to cure the cancer in my opinion if a person finds out that s he has cancer then s he should promptly try at least the first remedies described above in sequence

of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose
methodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to re examine
those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it is
also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double blind studies is
capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no

objectively verifiable but there is nothing objective about the process of science if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit
to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science this
is where you and i disagree with turpin in order to have science one
must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere
collection of empirically validated random hypotheses experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science but
they are merely the culmination of scientific research the most
important part of true scientific methodology is scientific thinking without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing no hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you re shaving or
looking out the window at least not unless you ve done a lot of really
good thinking beforehand the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocre
scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that
they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical
studies and it bothers me even more that there are many fields such as
certain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses and i m especially offended by russell turpin s repeated assertion that

the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea now

put into place programs to protect water sources from
contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment

his bath in neither case was there no connection to prior theories concepts etc as you stipulated above what there was was an intuitive leap beyond
the current way of thinking to develop ideas which subsequently proved
to have predictive power e g they stood the test of experimental
verification pardon my kibbutzing tom"
58776.eml,sci.med,"yes but typically they don t not every wild flight of fancy serves or can serve in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis it is
somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an
example of this sort the only one they come up with is the one about
kekule surely there must be others but apparently this is regarded
as an extreme example of a non rational process in science whereby
a successful hypothesis was proposed but how non rational is it of course we can t hope currently at least to explain how or why
kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails surely it wasn t the only daydream he had what was special about this one could it have had something to do with a perceived analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning
geometry of molecules is such analogical reasoning extra scientific or is it rather at the very heart of science perice s notion of abduction the use of models within and across disciplines upon close examination is there a non rational mystical leap taking place or is it perhaps
closer to a formal though often incomplete analogy or model"

58778.eml,sci.med,"i think that lee lady and i are talking at cross purposes above lady seems concerned with the contrast between great
science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre
science that makes smaller steps in most of this thread i have
been concerned with the difference between what is science and
what is not lee lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between
einstein and the average post doc physicist is the quality of
their thought but what is the difference between einstein and a
genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts
are scientifically screwy some would give velikovsky or
korzybski as examples if you don t like these choose your
own i say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre
physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi both einstein and
the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the
cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong both velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to
do this let me approach this from a second direction when one is asked
to review a paper for a journal or conference there are many
kinds of criticism that one can make one kind of criticism is
that the work is just wrong or misinformed another kind of
criticism is that the work while technically correct is either
not important or not interesting the first difference is the
one that i have been pointing to the second difference is the
one that lee lady seems to be discussing i have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims not just of some of its proposed remedies similarly i suspect
that traditional chinese medicine has many remedies that work what it lacks as one example is any experiment that tests the
presence of qi certainly a theoretical structure that makes sense is the goal in areas where we do not yet have this i see nothing wrong with
forming and testing smaller hypotheses let s face it we cannot
always wait for an einstein to come along and make everything
clear for us sometimes those of us who are not einstein have to
plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can russell"
58779.eml,sci.med,"yeah but the problem with holding up the extra rational examples as

the quote your ideas are crazy to be sure but they are not crazy enough to be right the typical screwball is only somewhat screwy"
58788.eml,sci.med,"as has been noted before there is the distinction between motivation and method no experimental result should be accepted unless it is
described in sufficient detail to be replicated and the replications
do indeed reproduce the result no theoretical argument should be
accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed and
reasonable knowlegeable people agree with the force of the logic but people try experiments and pursue arguments for all sorts of crazy
reasons irrational motivations are not just curiousities they are a
large part of the history of science there are a couple of negative points to make here a theory of qi could conceivably become accepted without direct
verification of the existence of qi for example quarks are an accepted
part of the standard model of physics with no direct verification what
would be needed would be a theory based on qi that predicted medical
reality better than the alternatives the central theoretical claim could
lie forever beyond experiment as long as there was a sufficient body of
experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other i wouldn t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi though i don t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it much less
a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology and it
is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather
directly verifying the existence of qi science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational
experiment data theory sequence most experiments are carried out and
interpreted in pre existing theoretical frameworks the theoretical
controversies of the day determine which experiments get done overall there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivations petty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and which
computations get done what keeps it going forward is the critical
function of science results don t count unless they can be replicated the whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate and test the generate
part can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properly pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals but even mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed that when you separate them by handedness you get two chemicals that rotate
polarized light in opposite directions and the right rotating version was
indistinguishable from tartaric acid pasteur s irrational motivation had
led to a replicable and important result this is where lysenko creationists etc fail they have usually not
even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything when their
theories do predict and are contradicted by experiment they do not
concede the point and modify their theories rather they try to suppress
the results lysenko or try to divert attention to other evidence they
think supports their position creationists"

and relative to other chemical sources the remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study charles jackman the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was organized by dr michael prather nasa goddard institute for space studies the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia nasa giss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasa goddard space flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and environmental research inc the effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine industrial sources kilograms year natural sources kilograms year shuttle sources kilograms year the shuttle source assumes space shuttles and titan rockets are launched yearly thus the launches would add less than to the total stratospheric chlorine sources the effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by this is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares the influence of human made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a decrease in globally averaged ozone between and the influence of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible the launch schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in

aerospace medicine brooks afb texas how the challenger astronauts died the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion this is a well documented fact see the rogers commission report for example what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin team s medical forensic report the astronauts were killed when the more or less intact cabin hit the water at circa mph and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team examined them they were sent off to be buried using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you can t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit because it can t get there it is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between earth s surface and low orbit taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high orbit spacecraft yet another concise answer by henry

59850.eml,sci.space,archive name space astronaut how to become an astronaut first the short form authored by henry spencer then an official nasa announcement q how do i become an astronaut a we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since it s probably impossible for a non russian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have so few astronauts and fly even fewer that you re better off hoping to win a lottery becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast jet experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission specialist if you aren t a us citizen become one that is a must after that the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply nasa s problem is not finding qualified people but thinning the lineup down to manageable length it is not enough to be qualified you must avoid being dis qualified for any reason many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job get a ph d specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore seeable future degree s in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner be in good physical condition with good eyesight do not get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes and long term effects are poorly understood for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknowns if you can pass a jet pilot physical you should be okay if you can t your chances are poor practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions you ve got a tough selling job ahead trying to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants and also that you will be a credit to nasa after you are hired public relations is a significant part of the job and nasa s image is very prim and proper the image you want is squeaky clean workaholic yuppie remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent keep your nose clean get a pilot s license and make flying your number one hobby experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non pilot jobs work for nasa of astronauts selected between and were military or nasa employees and the remaining two were a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job at nasa take it sometimes in the past this has meant you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first think space they want highly motivated people so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation keep trying many astronauts didn t make it the first time nasa national aeronautics and space administration lyndon b johnson space center houston texas announcement for mission specialist and pilot astronaut candidates astronaut candidate program

59871,sci.space,"archive name space intro frequently asked questions on sci space sci astro introduction this series of linked messages is periodically posted to the usenet
groups sci space and sci astro in an attempt to provide good answers to
frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth
preserving if you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked
questions that you would like included in this posting send email to jon leech if you don t want to see the faq add frequently asked questions to
your kill file for this group if you re not reading this with a newsreader
that can kill articles by subject you re out of luck the faq volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down
by rewriting and condensing over time the faq postings are available in
the ames space archive in faq faq good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here the
point of this is to circulate existing information and avoid rehashing old
answers better to build on top than start again nothing more depressing
than rehashing old topics for the th time references are provided
because they give more complete information than any short generalization questions fall into three basic types where do i find some information about space try your local public library first the net is not a good place to ask for general information ask individuals by email if you must there are other sources use them too the net is a place for open ended discussion i have an idea which would improve space flight hope you aren t surprised but out of have usually been thought of before again contact a direct individual source for evaluation nasa fields thousands of these each day miscellanous queries these are addressed on a case by case basis in the following series of faq postings suggestions for better netiquette read news announce newusers if you re on usenet minimize cross references do you really need to edit subject lines especially if you re taking a tangent send mail instead avoid posting follow ups mail message worth posts internet mail readers send requests to add drop to space request not space read all available articles before posting a follow up check all references cut down attributed articles leave only the points you re responding to remove signatures and headers summarize put a return address in the body signature of your message mail or article state your institution etc don t assume the reply function of mailers will work use absolute dates post in a timely way don t post what everyone will get on tv anyway some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping keep lines under characters for those using ascii terminals

59872,sci.space,archive name space net network resources overview you may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of computers so much of the material below may not apply to you in general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three categories internet usenet or bitnet electronic mail may be sent between these networks and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special servers the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them one mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list in addition to the general lists for space called space digest for internet users and space on bitnet there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below a second mechanism is usenet netnews this is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a group name the groups dealing most closely with space topics are called sci space news sci space sci space shuttle sci astro and talk politics space contributors post submissions called articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends it to other nearby machines similarly articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted gateway machines redirect the usenet sci space group into internet and bitnet mailing lists and vice versa the other usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists if you can receive netnews its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option mailing lists space digest is the main internet list and is now being run by the international space university in only its second change of management in over a decade email message body should be in the

upcoming missions call info at kennedy space center official nasa shuttle status reports are posted to sci space news frequently why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc g c says during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is commanded until an i loaded v rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q alpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved s band look angles and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target in second stage this really is a good answer but it s couched in nasa jargon i ll try to interpret we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly negative angle a negative q alpha this causes a little bit of downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z direction and this force alleviates structural loading we have to be careful about those wings they re about the most delicate part of the vehicle the new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn t roll performance gain the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae to have a good line of sight signal with the s band radio antennae on the orbiter improved s band look angles the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all begs the question why isn t the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with why does the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer is that the pads were leftovers from the apollo days the shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effects of this on any daytime launch the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn v s a side note the saturn v s also had a roll program don t ask me why i m a shuttle guy i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics he added that the roll maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack q alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a grad level

wiener contributed the section on voyager and the section on sakigake was obtained from isas material posted by yoshiro yamada us planetary missions mariner venus mars mercury flybys and orbiters mariner the first u s attempt to send a spacecraft to venus failed minutes after launch in the guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the onboard computer took control however there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it was actually a transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted from the expression r dot bar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation mariner became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a very hot degrees fahrenheit now revised to degrees f world with a cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid was later confirmed in mariner launched on november was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun s energy for power from its solar panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner mariner the sister probe to mariner did reach mars in and took the first close up images of the martian surface in all as it flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that mars was a dead world in both the geological and biological sense mariner was sent to venus in it reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by mariner plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least times that of earth s or the equivalent of being feet under the surface of an ocean mariner and were sent to mars in and expanded upon the work done by mariner four years earlier however they failed to take away the concept of mars as a dead planet first made from the basic measurements of mariner mariner ended up in the atlantic ocean in when the rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner the sister probe to mariner became the first craft to orbit mars in it returned information on the red planet that no other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the martian surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup images of mars two small moons phobos and deimos mariner used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in the probe did return the first close up images of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four earth days mariner eventually made three flybys of mercury from to before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which makes up percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters pioneer through failed to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close up but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon including new data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer was launched on october pioneer on november and pioneer on december pioneer was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first u s spacecraft to orbit the sun in pioneer was originally designed to flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to million kilometers in a record until mariner pioneer through were placed into solar orbit from to pioneer and are still transmitting information at this time pioneer e would have been number suffered a launch failure in pioneer became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in pioneer followed it in and then went on to become the first probe to study saturn in both vehicles should continue to function through and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venus also known as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october pvo made the first radar studies of the planet s surface via probe pioneer venus also known as pioneer sent four small probes into the atmosphere in december of the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day probe did make it and transmitted for minutes on the ground before its batteries failed ranger lunar lander and impact missions ranger and were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they were meant for high earth orbit testing in but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed ranger launched on january was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt ranger launched april had the same purpose as ranger but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside the first u s probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data ranger launched october and similar to ranger and lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit ranger through had more modified lunar missions they were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the moon ranger failed this objective in when its cameras did not operate ranger through performed well becoming the first u s lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter through were designed to orbit the moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo missions of the probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside all five probes of the series launched from to were essentially successful in their missions they were the first u s probes to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions surveyor lunar soft landers the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from to only surveyor and were unsuccessful missions the rest became the first u s probes to soft land on the moon taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis apollo landed feet from surveyor in and returned parts of the craft to earth surveyor the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region in viking mars orbiters and landers viking was launched from cape canaveral florida on august on a titan e centaur d rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse planitia on july it soon began its programmed search for martian micro organisms there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image the viking orbiter kept functioning until august when it ran out of attitude control propellant the lander was switched into a weather reporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through but after november an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders communication was never regained again despite the engineers efforts through may of an interesting side note viking s lander has been designated the thomas a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington d c is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition viking was launched on september and arrived in martian orbit on august the lander touched down on september in utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording one marsquake the orbiter had a series of attitude control gas leaks in which prompted it being shut down that july the lander was shut down on april the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around voyager outer planet flybys voyager was launched september and flew past jupiter on march and by saturn on november voyager was launched august before voyager and flew by jupiter on august by saturn on august by uranus on january and by neptune on august voyager took advantage of a rare once every years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet voyager could in principle have headed towards pluto but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up between the two probes our knowledge of the giant planets their satellites and their rings has become immense voyager discovered that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and aurorae three new satellites were discovered two of the major surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous volcanoes with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over ringlets and satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive jet streams with minimal variance a year great white spot band cycle is known titan s atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings braids kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found on ariel and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains satellites and one more ring were discovered in contrast to uranus neptune was found to have rather active weather including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring two other rings and other satellites were discovered neptune s magnetic axis was also skewed triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers what s liquid at k the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades their on target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause

one week before scheduled phobos landing while there has been talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years no major steps have yet been taken with these projects more intensive studies of the moon mars venus and various comets have been planned for the s and a mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for how the many changes in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen japanese planetary missions sakigake ms t was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on january and approached halley s comet within about million km on march the spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma waves solar wind all of which work normally now so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on january into an orbit similar to the earth s the closest approach was at h m s jst utc h on january the geocentric distance was km this is the first planet swingby for a japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observed the geotail some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence the second earth swingby will be on june at re earth s radius and the third october at re hiten a small lunar probe was launched into earth orbit on january the spacecraft was then known as muses a but was renamed to hiten once in orbit the lb probe looped out from earth and made its first lunary flyby on march where it dropped off its lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon joining the unites states and ussr the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remained in orbit around the moon an apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists to lose track of it hagoromo s rocket motor fired on schedule on march but the spacecraft s tracking transmitter failed immediately the rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt camera cm f at the kiso observatory in japan hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the earth s atmosphere hiten made a close approach to the moon at jst utc h on february at the height of km from the moon s surface n e and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit the following is the orbital calculation results after the approach apoapsis altitude about km periapsis altitude about km inclination deg to ecliptic plane period days

idea of the history of space exploration in this area i also recommend that you pick up some good up to date general works on astronomy and the sol system to give you some extra background most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library some of the more recently published works can also be purchased in and or ordered through any good mass market

by intelligences in interstellar space as well as the probes and planetary mission objectives themselves other works and periodicals nasa has published very detailed and technical books on every space probe mission it has launched good university libraries will carry these books and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission you wish to read about i recommend these works after you first study some of the books listed above some periodicals i recommend for reading on space probes are national geographic which has written articles on the pioneer probes to earth s moon luna and the jovian planets jupiter and saturn the ranger surveyor lunar orbiter and apollo missions to luna the mariner missions to mercury venus and mars the viking probes to mars and the voyager missions to jupiter saturn uranus and neptune more details on american soviet european and japanese probe missions can be found in sky and telescope astronomy science nature and scientific american magazines time newsweek and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions but also show you what else was going on with earth at the time events were unfolding if that is of interest to you space missions are affected by numerous political economic and climatic factors as you probably know depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go you might also wish to join the planetary society one of the largest space groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration their periodical the planetary report details the latest space probe missions write to the planetary society north catalina avenue pasadena california usa good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration i personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas in this field and the benefits human society has and will receive from it are incredible with many yet to be realized larry klaes next faq upcoming planetary probes missions and schedules

edition acronym list for sci astro sci space and sci space shuttle edition dec last posted aug this list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing
acronyms in the space related newsgroups if i forgot or botched your
favorite acronym please let me know also if there s an acronym not on this list that confuses you drop me a line and if i can figure
it out i ll add it to the list note that this is intended to be a reference for frequently seen acronyms and is most emphatically not encyclopedic if i incorporated
every acronym i ever saw i d soon run out of disk space the list will be posted at regular intervals every days all
comments regarding it are welcome i m reachable as note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for you re on your
own for figuring out what they mean note also that the total number of
acronyms in use far exceeds what i can list special purpose acronyms that
are essentially always explained as they re introduced are omitted further some acronyms stand for more than one thing as of edition of
the list these acronyms appear on multiple lines unless they re simply
different ways of referring to the same thing thanks to everybody who s sent suggestions since the first version of
the list and especially to garrett a wollman who is maintaining an independent list somewhat more verbose in
character than mine and to daniel fischer who is maintaining a truly huge list at last count of acronyms and
terms mostly in german which i read fortunately special thanks this time to ken hollis at nasa who sent me a copy of nasa
reference publication revised space transportation system and
associated payloads glossary acronyms and abbreviations a truly
mammoth tome almost pages of tlas special bonus at the end of this posting you will find a perl program
written by none other than larry wall whose purpose is to scramble the

upon whether the soviets tried to go setting up a lunar base

and touch down of course as henry pointed out vetical landings aren t quite
that simple well to be blunt yes but at least you re learning the soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
just before they hit the ground parachutes are however not especially

60187.eml,sci.space,"ssf is up for redesign again let s do it right this
time let s step back and consider the functionality we want microgravity vacuum process research life sciences research adaptation to space spacecraft maintenence the old nasa approach explified by shuttle and ssf so far was to
centralize functionality these projects failed to meet
their targets by a wide margin the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it and ssf has crumbled into disorganization
and miscommunication over billion has been spent on these
two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement
in commercial space industrialization meanwhile military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development the constellation firstly different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function thus we have the gps navstar constellation in hour orbits comsats in clarke and molniya orbits etc secondly the task
is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed ssf s main functions require quite different environments
and are also prime candidates for constellization we have the makings of a microgravity constellation now comet and mir for long duration flights shuttle spacelab for
short duration flights the best strategy for this area is
inexpensive incremental improvement installation of u s facilities on mir shuttle mir linkup and transition from shuttle spacelab
to a much less expensive ssto spacehab comet or ssto sif comet we might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments eg the high radiation van allen belt or gas plasma gradients in comet tails the comet system can
be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond leo we need to study life sciences not just in microgravity but also in lunar and martian gravities and in the radiation
environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter
of leo this is a very long term low priority project since
astronauts will have little practical use in the space program
until costs come down orders of magnitude furthermore using
astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation and the sample size so i propose labratsat a constellation
tether bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity
in super van allen belt orbits that are representative of the
radiation environment encountered on earth moon earth mars earth asteroid etc trips the miniaturized life support
machinery might be operated real time from earth thru a vr
interface after several orbital missions have been flown follow ons can act as ldefs on the lunar and martian surface testing out the actual environment at low cost before billions
are spent on astronauts by far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in clarke orbit i propose a fleet of small teleoperated
robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can
practice their skills once in place robots can pry stuck
solar arrays and antennas attach solar battery power packs inject fuel etc once the fleet is working it can be
spun off to commercial company s who can work with the comsat
companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards by applying the successful constellation strategy and getting
rid of the failed centralized strategy of sts and old ssf we
have radically improved the capability of the program while
greatly cutting its cost for a fraction of ssf s pricetag we can fix satellites where the satellites are we can study
life s adaptation to a much large more representative variety of space environments and we can do microgravity and vacuum
research inexpensively and if needed in special purpose
orbits n b we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration
as well greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality mars network and artemis are two good examples of this more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on mars that can be used
to fuel planet wide rover ballistic hopper prospecting and
sample return the descendants of labratsat s technology can
be used as a mars surface ldef and to test out closed ecology
greenhouses on mars at low cost"

beg your pardon for being too precise in my use of language i will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
technological and economic feasibility given the mixed nature of the
trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different run for each
actinide when i see them dump a few tons in one end and pull relatively clean material out the other once the costs technological risks etc are taken into account i still class this
one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun sure it s possible
and the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable
approach and i still wonder at what sort of burning rate you could get with
something like this as opposed to what kind of energy you would
really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power

murray washington state i started asking for an hour and when i heard
the gasp on the end of the phone i quickly backed off to an hour later in that conversation i learned that a standard appointment is minutes we got the standard bozo treatment that is we were called back by an aide who scheduled a meeting with us in order to determine that we were not
bozos and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material well i got allocated hour with sen murrays aide and we ended up talking
to him for minutes with us ending the meeting and him still listening we covered a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer there was another
woman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that
we brought up but with murray being new we wanted to entrench ourselves as non corporate
aligned i e not speaking for boeing local citizens interentested in space so we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to
leo solar power satellites are a big focus here so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that we hit the tourism angle and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism
paper with side notes being that everyone who goes into space and sees the
atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp after seeing the smog
over l a we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification which is more pronounced in space and said that that had potential to lead to understanding of and maybe a cure for osteoporosis we hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space but as they get older and find out that
they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there they go on to other
fields with low cost to orbit the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business
angle we hit the lower cost of satellite launches gps navigation personal
communicators tellecommunications new services etc jobs provided
in those sectors jobs provided building the thing balance of trade improvement etc we mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs we left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order
to make this even easier to do and he asked questions on this point we ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are
proceeding in this area and that we want to make sure that the
results from these efforts are not lost much like condor or majellan and most importantly we asked that she help fund further efforts along
the lines of lowering the cost to leo in the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data purchase act and the guy filed it separately he was very interested in it he asked some questions about it and seemed like he wanted to jump on it and contact some of the people involved with it so something may actually
happen immediatly there the last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we
knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they
could feel free to call us any time with questions and if we didn t know
the answers that we would see to it that they questions got to people who
really did know the answers then finally we asked for an appointment with the senator herself he
said that we would get on the list and he also said that knowing her this

discussed on sci space are covered in this gibbons outlines space station redesign guidance dr john h gibbons director office of science and
technology policy outlined to the members designate of
the advisory committee on the redesign of the space
station on april three budget options as guidance to
the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of
the space station a low option of billion a mid range option of billion and a high option of billion will be
considered by the committee each option would cover
the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year through and would include funds for
development operations utilization shuttle
integration facilities research operations support transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the
available funds over the next years billion is reserved within
the nasa budget for the president s new technology
investment as a result station options above billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in
the rest of the nasa budget for example a space
station option of billion would require billion
in offsets from the nasa budget over the next years gibbons presented the information at an organizational
session of the advisory committee generally the
members designate focused upon administrative topics
and used the session to get acquainted they also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation
on the process the station redesign team is following
to develop options for the advisory committee to
consider gibbons also announced that the united states and its
international partners the europeans japanese and
canadians have decided after consultation to give full consideration to use of russian assets in the
course of the space station redesign process to that end the russians will be asked to participate
in the redesign effort on an as needed consulting
basis so that the redesign team can make use of their
expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir and the
possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and
systems the u s and international partners hope to
benefit from the expertise of the russian participants
in assessing russian systems and technology the
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop
options for reducing station costs while preserving key
research and exploration capabilities careful
integration of russian assets could be a key factor in
achieving that goal gibbons reiterated that president clinton is
committed to the redesigned space station and to making
every effort to preserve the science the technology
and the jobs that the space station program represents however he also is committed to a space station that
is well managed and one that does not consume the
national resources which should be used to invest in

current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have
very little to nothing for future projects if he did that sure
in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular however starting a few years after he had retired he would become
one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not
funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments just

the high cost option as sawyer wrote the article goes on to describe the other two options
as one features modules that could gradually be fitted
together in orbit similar to the russian mir the
other is a core facility that could be deposited in
orbit in a single launch like skylab that option
would use existing hardware from the space shuttle the fuselage for example in its basic structure the last sentence in the article contradicts the title the first paragraph the sentence reads he o connor said a streamlined version of the planned

to be doing here at headquarters digging up old khz
data looking into sherzer kyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend
in kansas city at the national science teachers association conference extolling the virtues of ssf
to science teachers first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap does
exist if i recall the numbers correctly the total tax for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around million this was computed by adding up the wp wp and wp center taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at billion my calculater says the tax percentage is over the life of the ssf program using your figure of billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a rate comes to million this is alot less than billion but i
will concede it s still an appreciable amount of pocket
change i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at could
be close to the actual rate the tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some
states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant but you don t if you get it
take out for example at wp the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and are not subject to the center tax i don t have the numbers in
front of me but i d guess at least of the wp funds
go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax
rate of but it s only applied to funds spent at the
center and not to the prime contracts this leads to the obvious question what is the government
doing with ssf funds that don t go to the prime contractors i e ok wp gets a slice of the billion pie a
big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne what happens
to the balance of the funds which aren t eaten
up by the center tax at wp we call these funds we spend in house supporting
development funds as they are supporting the development
work done by rocketdyne we have used these funds to

test recently hit the four year life test milestone cells have completed to cycles the
on orbit batteries go through cycles per year as a final example my home division at lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations for performing system
analyses like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system availability calculations
using a monte carlo simulation setting up a database with information on weight of the power
system elements finally the money raised by the tax does not all
go into a slush fund at lewis the director
does control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however goes to fund the general services at the center like the library the central computer services division the contractor who removes the snow etc thus it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
ssf budget doesn t go for ssf activities to get
an accurate figure you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support ssf which would be hard to
compute by itself how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for aviation week for year is billable to ssf would you base it on
the person hours ssf employees spend reading av week
versus the rest of the center personnel you would
then have to compare this estimate of the ssf
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library who knows maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but
we underpay for snow removal talk about
a burecratic nightmare my last point is that i can t believe your claim that
congress has never heard of the term center tax unfortunately all of the nasa testimony before
congress isn t on a computer so i can t do a simple
word search someplace to prove you wrong but surely in some gao audit somewhere these nasa cost methods
were documented for congress"

california day mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc x rocket ship last
saturday the company hopes this single stage rocket technology
demonstrator will be the first step towards a single stage to orbit ssto rocket ship the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands
missile range in new mexico this week flight tests will start in
mid june although there wasn t a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for
ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization which paid million for the dc x can t itself afford to fund full development of a
follow on vehicle to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for
a sub orbital dc xa sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government
agencies sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for
orbital deployments of space based sensors and weapns however recent
changes in sdi s political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto
less of a priority today the agency is more interested in using dc x as
a step towards a low cost reusable sounding rocket sdio has already done briefings to other government agencies said col simon pete worden sdio s deputy for technology but worden
declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the
program i didn t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i
have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell
douglas astronautics headquarters while sdio has lowered its sights on the program s orbital
objective agency officials hail the dc x as an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware development the agency believes
this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of
evolutionary technology developments worden said the dc x illustrates how a build a little test a
little approach can produce results on time and within budget he said
the program which went from concept to hardware in around months showed how today s engineers could move beyond the miracles of our
parents time the key is management worden said sdio had a very light hand
on this project we had only one overworked major jess sponable although the next phase may involve more agencies worden said
lean management and a sense of government industry partnership will be
crucial it s essential we do not end up with a large management
structure where the price goes up exponentially sdio s approach also won praise from two california members of the
house science space and technology committee this is the direction
we re going to have to go said rep george brown the committee s
democratic chairman programs that stretch aout to years aren t
sustainable nasa hasn t learned it yet sdio has rep dana rohrbacher brown s republican colleague went further joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it
were left to the civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district includes mcdonnell
douglas also criticized nasa air force work on conventional multi staged
rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology let s not
build fancy ammunition with capsules on top let s build a spaceship although rohrbacher praised sdio s sponsorship he said the
private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology mcdonnell douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its
c transport and space station freedom programs were more cautious
about a large private secotro commitment on very large ventures companies put in seed money said charles ordahl mcdonnell douglas senior vice president for space systems you need strong government
investments while the government and industry continue to differ on funding
for the dc xa they agree on continuing an incremental approach to
development citing corporate history they liken the process to douglas
aircraft s dc aircraft just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for
the dc transport a gradual evolution in single stage rocketry could
eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc flight tests this summer at white sands will expand the envelope of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude the
first tests will reach feet and demonstrate hovering verticle
take off and landing the second series will send the unmanned dc x up to feet the third and final series will take the craft up to feet maneuvers will become more complex on third phase the final
tests will include a pitch over manever that rotates the vehicle back
into a bottom down configuration for a soft four legged landing the flight test series will be supervised by charles pete conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo moon landing now a mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised the vehicles
aircraft like approach to operations features include automated
check out and access panels for easy maintainance if the program moves to the next stage engine technology will
become a key consideration this engine would have more thrust than the
pratt whitney rl a engines used on the dc x each motor uses liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to pounds of
thrust based on the engine used in centaur upper stages the a model
has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three to on
throttling capability it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid
turnaround worden said future single stage rockets could employ
tri propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and
then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes the mechanism for the teaming may already be in place pratt has
a technology agreement with npo energomash the design bureau responsible

policy outlined to the members designate of the advisory committee on the
redesign of the space station on april three budget options as guidance
to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space
station a low option of billion a mid range option of billion and a
high option of billion will be considered by the committee each
option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year through and would include funds for development operations utilization shuttle integration facilities research
operations support transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds over the next years billion is reserved within the nasa
budget for the president s new technology investment as a result station options above billion must be accompanied by offsetting
reductions in the rest of the nasa budget for example a space station
option of billion would require billion in offsets from the nasa
budget over the next years gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of
the advisory committee generally the members designate focused upon
administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted they also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the
station redesign team is following to develop options for the advisory
committee to consider gibbons also announced that the united states and its
international partners the europeans japanese and canadians have
decided after consultation to give full consideration to use of
russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process to that end the russians will be asked to participate in the
redesign effort on an as needed consulting basis so that the redesign
team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of mir
and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems the u s and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of
the russian participants in assessing russian systems and technology the
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing
station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes careful integration of russian assets could be a key factor in achieving
that goal gibbons reiterated that president clinton is committed to the
redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the
science the technology and the jobs that the space station program
represents however he also is committed to a space station that is well
managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should

least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is
and is not debate suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last
point why don t you take a poll fred if you want some psuedo objective
point of view and as usual you defend your insults with he started it yeah i
took some of his research and called it my own but he started it so
what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first besides that i
think it s still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of

never borrowed it i already gave it back and it was broken when you
gave it to me make up yer mind fred first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am rewarded
with a denial of sorts and a smart remark then i point out that i am
not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly
interpreting you a second time and i m stupid for it i just can t win can i fred you ve got a great point here somewhere it s just that
between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of
your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it fred issue nick s alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick s or you
would have a really good point instead you have provided a good reason
to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations
that you have made about others forgive me for giving your insults more
meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that people aren t required in
all parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his opinions
regarding people in the space program i read as people are required in
all parts of all space processes so help me out here fred since i m
so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat
your terminal now if the latter i sure hope it s one of those cheeto and

only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it but alas that s your
job fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory insult sadly one point addressed a plan that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that
you do as much as anyone no no i finally got it you don t like the plan that nick s posts made
you imagine and you don t like nick s obnoxious behavior even though
it s no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone as

just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that s
no worse than your own let s see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn t and my
complaints about your name calling are immature while your name calling

your insulting of people that try proves i didn t really care about

bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable

successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to
measure and study chemicals in the earth s ozone layer the april flight from california s barstow daggett airport
reached an altitude of kilometers feet and took
measurements as part of a program established to correlate data
with the upper atmosphere research satellite uars the data from the balloon flight will also be compared to
readings from the atmospheric trace molecular spectroscopy atmos experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle
discovery we launch these balloons several times a year as part of an
ongoing ozone research program in fact jpl is actively
involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three
important ways said dr jim margitan principal investigator on
the balloon research campaign there are two jpl instruments on the uars satellite he
continued the atmos experiment is conducted by jpl scientists and the jpl balloon research provides collaborative ground truth
for those activities as well as data that is useful in its own
right the measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more
pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere specifically the
mid latitude stratosphere during winter and spring understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps
scientists construct more accurate computer models which are
instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions the scientific balloon payload consisted of three jpl
instruments an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures
ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave
radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere and a fourier
transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the
atmosphere absorbs sunlight launch occurred at about noontime and following a three hour ascent the balloon floated eastward at approximately kilometers per hour knots data was radioed to ground
stations and recorded onboard the flight ended at p m pacific time in eastern new mexico when the payload was commanded
to separate from the balloon we needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared
measurements margitan explained and we also needed to fly in
darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear it will be several weeks before scientists will have the
completed results of their experiments they will then forward
their data to the uars central data facility at the goddard space
flight center in greenbelt maryland for use by the uars
scientists the balloon was launched by the national scientific balloon
facility normally based in palestine tex operating under a

anyway feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might
benefit from what it says may god richly bless those who read it d o e s g o d l o v e y o u q what kind of question is that anyone who can read sees signs tracts books and bumper stickers that say god loves you isn t that true a it is true that god offers his love to the whole world as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the bible for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life john however god s love is qualified the bible says the way of the wicked is an abomination unto the lord but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness proverbs for the lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly shall perish psalm q but i am not wicked i am a decent moral person surely the good i have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad i have done how can these verses apply to me a by god s standard of righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by god as a desperate sinner on his way to hell the bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to heaven on the contrary we are all sinners and we are all guilty before god as it is written there is none righteous no not one there is none that understandeth there is none that seeketh after god romans the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it jeremiah q if i am such a wicked person in god s sight what will god do to me a the bible teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called hell for a fire is kindled in mine anger and shall burn unto the lowest hell and shall consume the earth with her increase and set on fire the foundations of the mountains i will heap mischiefs upon them i will spend mine arrows upon them they shall be burnt with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction i will also send the teeth of beasts upon them with the poison of serpents of the dust deuteronomy q oh come on now hell is not real is it surely things are not that bad a indeed hell is very real and things are that bad for the individ ual who does not know the lord jesus christ as savior the bible makes many references to hell indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation so shall it be at the end of the world the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just and shall cast them into the furnace of fire there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth matthew when the lord jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not god and that obey not the gospel of our lord jesus christ who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the lord and from the glory of his power thessalonians q that is terrible why would god create a hell a hell is terrible and it exists because god created man to be accountable to god for his actions god s perfect justice demands payment for sin for the wages of sin is death romans for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that every one may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad corinthians but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment matthew q does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to hell a indeed it does that is unless we can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal damnation for our sins that someone is god himself who came to earth as jesus christ to bear the wrath of god for all who believe in him all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way and the lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all isaiah but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed isaiah for i delivered unto you first of all that which i also received how that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures corinthians for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of god in him corinthians q are you saying that if i trust in christ as my substitute who was already punished for my sins then i will not have to worry about hell anymore a yes this is so if i have believed in christ as my savior then it is as if i have already stood before the judgment throne of god christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins he that believeth on the son hath everlasting life and he that believeth not the son shall not see life but the wrath of god abideth on him john q but what does it mean to believe on him if i agree with all that the bible says about christ as savior then am i saved from going to hell a believing on christ means a whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the bible it means that we hang our whole lives on him it means that we entrust every part of our lives to the truths of the bible it means that we turn away from our sins and serve christ as our lord no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other ye cannot serve god and mammon matthew repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the lord acts q are you saying that there is no other way to escape hell except through jesus what about all the other religions will their followers also go to hell a yes indeed they cannot escape the fact that god holds us account able for our sins god demands that we pay for our sins other religions cannot provide a substitute to bear the sins of their followers christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us neither is there salvation in any other for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved acts jesus said i am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me john if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness john q now i am desperate i do not want to go to hell what can i do a you must remember that god is the only one who can help you you must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of god as you see your hopeless condition as a sinner cry out to god to save you and the publican standing afar off would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smote upon his breast saying god be merciful to me a sinner luke sirs what must i do to be saved and they said believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved acts q but how can i believe on christ if i know so little about him a wonderfully god not only saves us through the lord jesus but he also gives us the faith to believe on him you can pray to god that he will give you faith in jesus christ as your savior for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god ephesians god works particularly through the bible to give us that faith so if you really mean business with god about your salvation you should use every opportunity to hear and study the bible which is the only word of god in this brochure all verses from the bible are within indented paragraphs give heed to them with all your heart so then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of god romans q but does this mean that i have to surrender everything to god a yes god wants us to come to him in total humility acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness trusting totally in him the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise psalm because we are sinners we love our sins therefore we must begin to pray to god for an intense hatred of our sins and if we sincerely desire salvation we will also begin to turn from our sins as god strengthens us we know that our sins are sending us to hell unto you first god having raised up his son jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities acts q doesn t the bible teach that i must attend church regularly and be baptized will these save me a if possible we should do these things but they will not save us no work of any kind can secure our salvation salvation is god s sovereign gift of grace given according to his mercy and good pleas ure salvation is not of works lest any man should boast ephesians q what else will happen at the end of the world a those who have trusted in jesus as their savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with christ forever more for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord thessalonians q what will happen to the earth at that time a god will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where christ will reign with his believers forever more but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness peter q does the bible give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come a yes the end will come when christ has saved all whom he plans to save and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come matthew q can we know how close to the end of the world we might be a yes god gives much information in the bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved it will not come as a thief for the believers there is much evidence in the bible that the end of the world and the return of christ may be very very close all the time clues in the bible point to this for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child and they shall not escape thessalonians surely the lord god will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets amos q but that means judgment day is almost here a yes it does god warned ancient nineveh that he was going to destroy that great city and he gave them forty days warning and jonah began to enter into the city a day s journey and he cried and said yet forty days and nineveh shall be overthrown jonah q what did the people of nineveh do a from the king on down they humbled themselves before god repented of their sins and cried to god for mercy but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto god yea let them turn every one from his evil way and from the violence that is in their hands who can tell if god will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger that we perish not jonah q did god hear their prayers a yes god saved a great many people of nineveh q can i still cry to god for mercy so that i will not come into judg ment a yes there is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him hebrews in god is my salvation and my glory the rock of my strength and my refuge is in god trust in him at all times ye people pour out your heart before him god is a refuge for us psalm a r e y o u r e a d y t o m e e t g o d a

20490.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my
wife and me lately liturgy in particular catholic liturgy in the last few
years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during mass it s
driving me crazy the most grace filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is
that what happens is something we all do together because we all know how to do it led by the priest of course which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to god but the best masses i ve been to were participatory prayers lately i think the proportion of participation has fallen and the proportion
of sitting there and watching or listening or generally being told what to do which is necessary because no one knows what s happening next is growing example last sunday palm sunday we went to the local church usually
on palm sunday the congregation participates in reading the passion taking
the role of the mob the theology behind this seems profound when we say crucify him we mean it we did it and if he came back today we d do it
again it always gives me chills but last week we were invited to sit
during the gospel passion and listen besides the orwellian invitation i was really saddened to have my and our little role taken away this seems
typical of a shift of participation away from the people and toward the
musicians readers and so on new things are introduced in the course of the
liturgy and since no one knows what s happening the new things have to be
explained and pretty soon instead of doing a lot of the mass we re just
sitting there listening or spacing out in my case to how the mass is about
to be done in my mind i lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay experts but that may not be just i do think that a liturgy committee has a
bias toward doing something rather than nothing that s just a fact of
bureaucratic life even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for
people to be aware of the lord s presence so we ve been wondering are we the oddballs or is the quality of the mass
going down i don t mean that facetiously we go to mass every thursday or
friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of god s presence but as far as the obligatory sunday masses maybe i should just offer it up has anyone else noticed declining congregational
participation in catholic masses lately john murray"

20499.eml,soc.religion.christian,"there are a lot of people running around saying god told me this and god told me that these days some people really have heard god and others
heard their glands mario murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once he
said someone told him the lord gave me a song he said that it was
the worst song he had ever heard i know why he gave you that song murillo said he didn t want it anymore but god does still speak to his people today and the idea is contrary to the
idea of a closed cannon ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the spirit
in the church of his day nd and rd century and he was one of the first
to put forth a new testament cannon which was almost identical to the one
we have today he believed in a closed cannon many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the scriptures for example one prophet in kings whose name starts with an m who
prophecied that the king would lose a battle that is the only prophecy
he gave recorded in scripture and we no that he had given other prophecies
because the king complained before he heard the prophecy he never prophesies
anything good about me yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in scripture there are numerous examples barnabas was a prophet acts says before he was even sent out as an apostle yet his writings are not recorded in scripture only two of
agabus prophecies are mentioned in scripture he was already a prophet
before he gave them so prophecy may be genuine and from god but that does not make it scripture i don t know about translations of scripture but i am familiar with prophecies that give applications for scripture there are also similar examples in the bible several times peter interprets prophecies
in a seemingly prophetic way for example and his bishoprick let another
take concerning judas office a clearer example can be found in matthew jesus is prophesying about
what will happen before his return and he quotes a passage out of joel
about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood so scriptural
prophecy can be used in later prophecy sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge but gifts of the spirit seem to overlap words of knowledge and wisdom
can overlap the word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy healings are often
considered miracles so sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy imho it doesn t usually matter that much if we are able to
label a phenomenon as long as we recognize them as the work of the spirit and use them according to his leading link hudson"
20500.eml,soc.religion.christian,"yes it s important to realize that all actions have consequences and that rules were made for our own good but to suggest that a disease is a punishment for certain types of sin i think is taking things much too far if we got some kind of mouth disease
for lying would any of us have mouths left what if we developed
blindness every time we lusted after someone or something i dare
say all of us would be walking into walls yes sin can have terrible consequences but we need to be real careful when saying that the consequences are a punishment for sin the jews of jesus s time believed that all sickness was the
result of a sin then jesus healed a blind man and said that man was
blind to show the glory of god not because of sin if aids or any
other std is a punishment for sexual sin what do we do with diseases like cancer or multiple sclerosis which are just as
debilitating and terrible as aids yet are not usually linked to a
specific behavior or lifestyle atonement is extremely important but i think you ve missed the mark
about as far as you can by suggesting that aids is an atonement for sin the atonement for sin is jesus christ period this is the central
message of the gospel a perfect sacrifice was required for our sins and was made in the lamb of god his sacrifice atoned for all of
our sins past present and future god does not require pennance for
our sins nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement he
has graciously already done that for us to suggest that aids or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting
on the sacrifice that jesus made in case you couldn t tell i get extremely angry and upset when
i see things like this instead of rationalizing our own fears and
phobias we need to be reaching out to people with aids and other
socially unacceptable diseases whether they got the disease through
their own actions or not is irrelevant they still need jesus christ no more and no less than we do i ve said this before but i think
it s a good analogy people with aids are modern day lepers jesus
healed many lepers he can also heal people with aids maybe not on
this earth but in an ultimate sense my next door neighbor has aids she has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with god her theology isn t what i would want it to be but god s grace covers her the amazing thing is that she is gaining
weight she s had the disease for over years and her health is
excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such she attributes

listening if so why don t we get some dialog going here here s a topic to get things started my daughter s christian school sends
home a weekly update on school related topics this week they sent
something very interesting it was an article written by the leader of a
national us christian school organization about a trip he recently made
to jerusalem while there he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is
working on a project to rebuild the temple at jerusalem the article
included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in
preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the
specifications given in the bible what was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are
complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the israeli
government before beginning the building the other startling fact is the
very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is
unoccupied and available for building previously it has been thought that
the original site was underneath what is now a mosque making rebuilding
impossible without sparking a holy war now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming
sacrifices as the scriptures indicate will happen in the last days although the israeli government will give the permission to start i think
it is the hand of god holding the project until he is ready to let it
happen brothers and sisters the time is at hand our redemption is

20505.eml,soc.religion.christian,much of the excellent post deleted for space tjl with all the suffering and persecution that it meant to be a believer it would be quite probable that at least one of those in the supposed conspiracy would come forward and confess that the whole thing was a big hoax yet not one did it seems rather reasonable that the disciples did not make up the resurrection but sincerely believed that jesus had actually risen from the dead especially in light of the sufferings that came upon those who believed i was at the jubilee conference this year in pittsburgh pa and the speaker there spoke of this as well he talked about many of the same things you mentioned in your post but here he went into a little more detail i ll paraphrase as best i can suppose you were part of the christian consipracy which was going to tell people that christ had risen never mind the stoning the being burned alive the possible crucifixion let s just talk about a scourging the whip that would be used would have broken pottery metal bone and anything else that they could find attached to it you would be stood facing a wall with nothing to protect you when the whip hit you the first time it would tear the flesh off you with instant incredibly intense pain you would think to yourself all this for a lie the second hit would drop you to your knees you would scream out in agony that your raw back was being torn at again you would say to yourself all this for a lie and you had more coming at the third hit you would scream out that it was all a lie beg for them to stop and tell them that you would swear on your life that it had all been a lie if they would only stop it is amazing enough that those who believed kept their faith under such torture but for a lie there is no one fool enough to do that and no one came forward excellent post john thanks for taking the time
20506.eml,soc.religion.christian,"is life a pass fail course and does god grade on a
curve i m new here and only vaguely religious but i want to
know what some of you people think specifically are there an
infinite number of heavens and a person goes to the one that
he she deserves or is it simply heaven or nothing hell also are we graded by those around us or has there always
been some unchanging method is the person s childhood taken
into account i m sure these must sound like over simplifications to
most of you but i figure that you re the experts quinn eschatology is an area on which christians do not agree i suspect
that s because our primary source of information is prophets and
visionaries and their writings tend to be highly symbolic however
both jesus teachings in the gospels and books such as the revelation
to john talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and
eternal death on a number of occasions jesus does say things that
imply some sort of differentiation e g lk and a number of
similar passages where jesus says things like even xxx will be better
off than you in the judgement also i cor talks about someone who
gets into heaven but by the skin of his teeth as it were but these
passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or
hell and not all christians would even go as far as that the only
christian group i know of that believes in multiple heavens is the
mormons and they are very far from mainstream christianity far
enough that many of our readers would not call them christian their
ideas in this area involve specific mormon revelations in addition
to the bible and holy tradition of a more generic christian sort note that many christians will cringe at the very thought of
associating grading with god the whole point of christ was to free
us from the results of a test that we couldn t possibly pass if you
like test analogies god grades on a very strict and unbending scale but he also cheats he replaces our test papers with an exam that
was prepared by the teacher before actually doing the grading because some people end up in heaven and others in hell it s easy to
see why you d be inclined to think of it as grading while there are
differences among branches of christianity on details i think we all
agree that in one way or another god cheats i am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly
how far god s cheating extends will he accept people who don t
explicitly acknowledge christ but somehow still follow him in their
hearts many christians believe that this is possible at least in
principle but certainly not all do jesus provided us with a clear
description of how to be saved but it s not clear to me that he
provided an exact description of how he s going to place the dividing
line certainly he made it clear that we can t expect to know whether
other individuals are saved or not clh"
20507.eml,soc.religion.christian,"this is one of the differences between ot prophecy and nt prophecy in the

about you but i know that i have made mistakes while filled with the
spirit if you don t give grace to allow people to make mistakes they
will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts when we minister in my small group i encourage people to speak out any
impressions or images they think might be from the lord only by trying
will they know whether they were right or wrong and in either case they ll have a better handle on it the next time didn t you fall when you were learning to ride a bicycle but you kept on
trying and you learned both from your failures and your successes spiritual gifts are no different you get better with experience the canon of scripture is complete does this mean that god no longer
speaks i have heard his voice not audibly though some have but
clearly nonetheless is what i heard equivalent to scripture no i have
never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the
lord is on the same level as scripture on the contrary those who are
mature obey the scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow
believers for judgement and the most reliable yardstick for judging
prophecies is certainly the scriptures themselves the canon is closed but god is not silent does it matter what it is called the question is not how to label it but
how to receive it words of knowledge incidentally are similar to
prophecy and sometimes the two overlap but generally it is supernatural
knowledge of some fact that could not be known otherwise"
20508.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i sent in something on this before but i believe it got lost in the
weekend accident the moderator described this is an improved
version anyway so no loss the first time hl the standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of friedrich blass hermeneutrik und kritik einleitende und hilfsdisziplinen vol of handbuch der klassischen altertums wissenshaft noerdlingen beck portions of this are described in nibley the prophetic book op mormon pp slc deseret book if you want to attempt reading this be forewarned nibley
describes blass as a typical german scholar who claims little
knowledge of his subject then proceeds to exhaust both the subject
and the reader nibley s extract from blass s work is in the form
of rules for forgers it makes interesting reading i confess that i have not read blass s work only nibley s extract
thereof my german falls far short of what would be required and
as far as i know there is no english translation available however i believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient
document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame we will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery actually there are types of purportedly ancient documents alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof for example
the dead sea scrolls these can be tested by various scientific
means to determine the age of the paper inks and objects found
with them this can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual
physical objects documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the
copy itself may be much more recent for example we might find a
document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something
from centuries ago perhaps even having been through several
generations of copists this is more of a problem but can still be tested although the test is not likely to be simple we cannot
expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so
we must confine our testing to the text itself it is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if
the document is really what it claims to be they can only date the
document and identify its culture of origin for example i ve heard
of a letter supposed to have been written by jesus himself to a king
in what is now iraq if this document were to actually turn up
scholars could date the paper and ink assuming they have the
holograph they could check the language content and writing
style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a
palestinian jew of that time however even if all test results were
positive there is no way to determine if jesus himself actually
wrote it we would know what time and culture it came from but barring a known sample of jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison scholarship must stop there there is seldom any way to
determine who the actual author was as i say i m no expert on blas s work i do remember some of the
tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works specifically we might ask is the document internally consistent does it contradict
itself if the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency even if it is a forgery the longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency for this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents is it consistent with the history and geography of the time again a short non specific work might not be testable but if the
writing is of any significant length no latter day forger would be
able to escape detection here we look for the minor inconspicuous
things which someone from that culture would get right without even
thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check the devil is in the details what about the literary style of the work figures of speech
etc any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us are there any such odd phrases in this book if so do they fit in with the culture of course there are complications if the document has been
translated or possibly even if somebody just updated language
when he copied it a few cases of language not from the culture
claimed may be allowed in recent copies they cause problems and
reduce certainty to be sure but don t necessarily prove forgery these tests can be quite effective given enough material to work with but they are not easy they require the skills of the historian the linguist the anthropologist etc the questions to ask are is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin if there are things which don t fit how significant are they are problem areas due to
our lack of knowledge later changes by copists or are they really significant there will often be some ambiguity since we never
know everything about the culture the end result of any such testing is occasionally certain particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies however often it may just be a probability or an indication that
the document or maybe parts of it is probably authentic or
sometimes maybe other parts are later additions this is often unsettling to a generation raised on tv where all problems are
solved in to minutes with time out for commercials it is however the real world and what scholarship has to offer"
20509.eml,soc.religion.christian,"a question for you can you give me the name of an organization or a
philosophy or a political movement etc which has never had anything
evil done in its name you re missing a central teaching of christianity man is inherently sinful we are saved through faith by grace knowing
that believing that does not make us without sin furthermore not all
who consider themselves christians are even those who manage to head
their own churches not everyone who says to me lord lord will
enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who
is in heaven matt again what historical documents do you trust do you think hannibal
crossed the alps how do you know how do you know for sure what
historical documents have stood the scrutiny and the attempts to dis credit it as well as the bible has well it s really a shame you feel this way no one can browbeat you
into believing and those who try will probably only succeed in driving
you further away you need to ask yourself some difficult questions is there an afterlife and if so does man require salvation to attain
it if the answer is yes the next question is how does man attain this
salvation can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain
modern offshoots like the new age movement teach or does he require god s
help if the latter in what form does indeed in what form can such
help come needless to say this discussion could take a lifetime and for
some people it did comprise their life s writings so i am hardly in a
position to offer the answers here merely pointers to what to ask few of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives certainly not me the spritual life is a difficult journey if you ve never read a pilgrim s

conflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing you
wrote that i in my own faith accept and live my life by many if not most
of the teachings of christ well christ referred to god as my father not my mother and while the maleness of god is not the same as the
maleness of those of us humans who possess a y chromosome it does not
honor god to refer to him as female purely to be trendy non discriminatory or politically correct this in no way disparages women nor is it my intent
to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns after all god
chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing christ into the human
population well i m not about to launch into a detailed discussion of
the role of women in christianity at am with only hours of sleep in the

mental facilities developed religious as a satisfiable solution to
explain the unexplainable for example the ancient greeks believed
that apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real due
to the advancement of our technology we know this to be false christianity is an infectious cult the reasons it flourishes are because it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life
a safety blanked to hide behind oh wow all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and i get eternal happiness for all of you found jeezus how many of you were on the brink but i digress the other reason christianity flourishes is its
infectious nature a best friend of mine breifly entered a christian
group and within months they set ministry guidelines for him which
basicaly said this priority spread the word we are just animals we need sleep food and we reproduce and we
die religion especially christianity is nothing more than a drug some people use drugs as an escape from reality christians inject
themselves with jeezus and live with that high it pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious
wars of which christianity has had no small part when christians see a non believer they say that person is blind
to the truth but they cannot realize that it is they who live

rational tradition aquinas et al and the emotional authenticity in comp with the faddishness of anglicanism to roman catholicism i
never had much time for the pope or any other heirarchs but i did and
do believe in the sacremental system i always felt quite happy to
look down my nose at those such as john emery a few posts back who
had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith entirely
oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same with
miracles too and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the
bible as god s sole revelation it was not very good logic to argue
that the bible proved god no i was happy to accept the church as god s
revelation it was the church after all that existed before the bible the
church that choose under grace of course the canon of scripture protestant
ludicrosity i thought was shown by protestants breathtaking acceptance
of luther s right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked but recently i read peter brown s body and society it is very
well researched and well written but is raises some very upsetting
questions the early christians were weird even more so than today s
carzy fundies they had odd views on sex odder views on the body totally ludicrous views about demons and distinctly uncharitable
views about other human beings now the question is this were the first christians just as
weird but we ve got used to them or did the pristine fall of the
church happen within one generation it certainly did nt have to
wait until the triumph of the church under constantine if so wha does this say about god s promise to always support the church it s no use throwing the usual protestant pieties about the church
not being an organization at me it s a community or it is nothing and it was the early communities that were weird the institional
church was a model of sanity by comparison i would be interested in serious catholic and orthodox responses to
this entirely serious issue i m not sure it is an issue for protestants
with their soul alone with jesus approach but for we who see the ecclesia as a koinoia over time and space the weird early
christians are a problem this is an exaggeration of the protestant view many protestants
have a strong appreciation for the role of the church the soul
alone with god is certainly important for protestants but it s by no
means the whole story i have read the sort of history you talk about as you point out protestants don t have quite the same problem you do because we
believe that the church had a fall at some point however protestant
mythology typically places the fall around the time of constantine or
more likely regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion starting from constantine but getting worse as the pope accumulated
power during the medieval period the consequences of having it
earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us most protestants accept
the theological results of the early ecumenical councils including
such items as the trinity and incarnation indeed in the works of
reformers such as luther and calvin you ll find church fathers such
as augustine quoted all the time i think you ll find many
protestants resistant to the idea that the early church as a whole was wierd there is an additional problem for protestants that i don t
much want to talk about in this context since it s been looked at
recently that s the question of whether one can really think of
augustine and other fathers as being proto protestants their views
on mary the authority of the pope etc are not entirely congenial to
protestant thought one thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology there are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church what
concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see we
see every christian who courted martyrdom but i think there s good
reason to believe that most ordinary christians were more prudent than
that we see the heroic virgins but i think there s good reason to
think that many christians were happily married i can t help
suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and
sane people that we do now i think there s also a certain level of revisionism active in history at the moment i don t mean that
they re manufacturing things out of whole cloth but don t you think
there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel clh"

catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting
their rosary beads during mass i find this comment interesting there
is a massively longer tradition for proclaiming the passion accounts
without active participation if you know the latin one really
beautiful way to hear the passion is it s being chanted by three
deacons the narrator chants in the middle baritone range jesus chants
in the bass and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor this is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the passion
that john would prefer but there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations each pastor makes his own decisions it isn t a church wide conspiracy
against participation the palm sunday liturgy with its initial
blessing and distribution of the palms and procession is already
getting long before you get to the passion some pastors feel that they
should not make the people stand through that long narrative also the
orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation
in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single reader proclamation in churches with multiple masses for the sunday it might be
necessary to go with the briefer options just to get em in and get em
out each parish is different catholics are no longer canonically tied to
their geographic parishes it is possible that another catholic parish
in the columbus area based on the ohio state address has a liturgy
closer to your preferences or talk to some of your fellow
parishioners and see how common your preferences are pastors
generally are willing to listen to non confrontational requests though
you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly
to the shock of people asked for a longer sunday mass perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn t follow
the continuous evolution model the accumulation of small changes no
single one of which is too hard to take but rather the punctuated
equilibrium model things stay the same and we get accustomed to them then the marked mutation hits my apologies if i am mis remembering
the names of the evolutionary theories"
20527.eml,soc.religion.christian,"so what s your point mark s comment still is valid to suggest that
aids is deserved is ludicrous i sin i can resolve to abstain from sin and do weekly more often actually yet i routinely fail i surely do deserve what i get yet god compassionately provided the incarnate logos jesus as a rememdy and a way out of our situation if aids is deserved i surely deserve instant death just as much as do
we all as st paul so cogently remids us to willingly judge others as deserving punishment seems to me
to be the height of arrogance and lack of humility so what s the point here i can get aids and never engage in deviant sexual behavior in fact i could engage in lots
of deviant sexual behavior with hiv people and never be
infected aids is a consequence of particular behaviors many of which are not sexual and not all sexual behaviors
carry the risk of transmission the end of all things is to know love and serve god growing
daily closer through prayer meditation and discipline even so
i could get aids anyone could unless they remain forever celibate iv drug free and transfusion free larry overacker"
20528.eml,soc.religion.christian,"text deleted i wish that you had followed this thread before jumping to conclusions i haven t seen anybody write that aids was a punishment for certain
types of sin this includes mark ashley who you were responding to
here i myself wrote that when you don t do things god s way that
curses will come on you and others although one definition of curse is retribution i only meant harm or misfortune when i used the
word because god loves us he has told us the best way to live in his
bible god doesn t cause curses he warns us of them kevin davis wrote a while ago the bible makes it clear that we all equally deserve death which is
much worse than aids we have all hurt god with our sin paul conditt reveals his feelings the first issue you bring up is your anger it is obvious ly wrong to
be angry gal for any reason especially extremely angry
which is on par with hatred jesus has every reason to be angry at us
for putting him on the cross with our sin yet his prayer was forgive
them father they know not what they do knowing how forgiving jesus
has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of
love for him please don t give in to anger it will only cause
foolish quarrels and more bad feelings it s okay if you read something that bothers you but you need to
address it in a loving way if right now i felt like someone out
there was saying that god punishes gay or sexually immoral people with
aids because they deserve punishment that others don t then i would
frame a response something like this it makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that aids which is
simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other is god s punishment
for people who have committed certain sins god loves all of his
children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him we
will all be judged after we die but until then we all have the
opportunity to accept god s grace by earnestly seeking after him with
all of our hearts believing the gospel s testimony repenting of our
sin confessing that jesus is lord at baptism and living a new life
for him let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned god s arm is not
to short to save he will do anything he can to move a hardened heart
or a misled person he works for the good of all men even through
the worst of situations he has set the times and places for all men
that they may perhaps reach out and find him the second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears
of people with aids fortunately what you describe as seeing is
actually misperceiving you have been missing the points made in the
earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven t been
expressed i know that its sometimes hard to discount your
perceptions but please try to be open minded you are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people
because they all need jesus this is what my brothers and sisters and
i do on a daily basis if you would like to send me the name of the
city and state you live in i will find and get you in touch with some
brothers who have aids or know people with aids and live nearby you so
that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself the third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual
contracted aids how someone gets aids is only relevant to their
salvation in that there may be repetence involved the important point to be made however is that not listening to god s
commands or advice or warnings i e sinning causes harm or
misfortune to yourself and others for this reason a good way to
prevent the misfortune of aids which can be transmitted in sinful ways is to listen to god s advice and have sex only with your wife or
husband i hope that you are feeling better now paul love aaron cardenas"

those who accept the promise of god paul continued to emphasize that he

20534.eml,soc.religion.christian,"first of all the original poster misquoted the reference is from tim the author was paul and his revelations were anything but at best second hand and is came about that as saul journeyed he was approaching damascus and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him and he fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him saul saul why are you persecuting me and he said who art thou lord and he said i am jesus whom you are persecuting acts nas paul received revelation directly from the risen jesus pretty cool eh he
became closely involved with the early church the leaders of which were followers of jesus throughout his ministry on earth i agree i don t believe anyone but the spirit would be able to convince you the spirit exists please don t complain about this being circular i know
it is but really can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural this is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the bible the spirit is part of god how much closer to the source can you get the greek in timothy which is sometimes translated as inspired by god literally means god breathed in other words god spoke the actual words into the scriptures many theologians and bible scholars dr james boice is one that i can remember off hand get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of inspired by god that s what the verse taken from timothy was all about the continuity of a book written over a span of years by more than authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of god what source to you claim to have discovered which has information of superior
historicity to the bible certainly not josephus writings or the writings of the gnostics which were third century at the earliest jesus was fully god as well that s why i d assert that he is wise please rethink this last paragraph if there is no god which seems to be your
current belief then jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not
only did he assert that god exists but he claimed to be god himself regards
to c s lewis how then could you have the least bit of respect for jesus in conclusion be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based
on gut feelings about the text and other scholars unsubstantiated claims the bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out about your reading of the bible not only does the spirit inspire the
writers but he guides the reader as well we cannot understand it in the least without the spirit s guidance for to us god revealed them through the spirit for the spirit searches all things even the depths of god cor nas peace and may god guide us in wisdom carter c page of happiness the crown and chiefest part is wisdom a carpenter s apprentice and to hold god in awe this is the law that seeing the stricken heart of pride brought down other theologians get quite annoyed at the misleadingess of god breathed it s true that the greek word has as its roots god and breath however etymology doesn t necessarily tell you what a
word means otherwise goodbye would be a religious expression since it comes from god be with ye you have to look at how the

20537.eml,soc.religion.christian,"he doesn t contradict himself the church is to last for all time however there are those who use the church to bolster themselves this
is evident in many letters for instance paul talks about the super apostles to the corinthians corinthians he mentions
how people will be led away by miracles signs and wonders thessalonians he tells timothy that it is clear that some will
abandon the faith and teach lies timothy and that some will
search for teachers to suit what they want to hear timothy such passages go throughout the letters and jesus does warn about them matthew but look at the promise in this last part verse and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world
as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come even today there are false teachings i can name two which i am well familiar
with the non need of baptism and the praying of jesus into your life
for salvation both are taught both are dead wrong they have been
taken out of context from some verses interpreted from others and just
plain made up the only way jesus taught is given in luke and
luke he then commands baptism in matthew the

consciences which warn them about it however as in my case a
conscience can be hardened by sin s deceitfulness hebrews so
that the person has no idea or doesn t care about it that they are
sinning of course there are those sins which we do when we don t know
that they re sinful to begin with those take searching and examining
of scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and
change the best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful
possibilities is would jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in

20540.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the only unity i ve found which is true is when all parties involved are
disciples i came out of a church in which even the different
congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was
better and who had the better messages while none of them put anything
into practice from those messages since becoming a disciple i ve
found that when i travel to another church in the same movement they
are just as accepting there as any other we had a retreat back in
january when some of the congregation from louisville ky came up this
retreat was for college students and it was as though i had known even
the people from louisville for years and i had only become a disciple
the previous april and had never been to the church in kentucky one
of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self sacrifice that is only
one area in which disciples stand out from christians also another
part of unity is a common depth of conviction i ve also been a part of
some christian campus fellowships who were focused on unity between
churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved a lack of
conviction about everything they believed that was why they could be
unified they didn t care about the truth but delighted in getting along
together creeds what need is there of creeds when the bible stands firmly
better according to the scriptures splits and differences of opinion are going
to be there as per a previous note i mentioned that there are those
who teach falsely by many means there are also differences of opinion
and belief however scripture states in the following directives i have no praise for you for your
meetings do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when
you come together as a church there re divisions among you and to some
extent i believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to
show which of you have god s approval corinthians how will god show his approval by fruitfulness see acts but
before that there are these qualities devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for god all having everything in common glad and sincere hearts praising god enjoying the favor of the people
all these are mentioned in acts god also shows that those who
have these qualities are persecuted look at stephen a man full of
faith and of the holy spirit acts who was later stoned acts one can say that a church is the true church only if that church is
perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement i
have yet to find that but the closest one i ve found is the boston
church of christ movement which constantly strives to have errors
pointed out and corrected it is also the only one i ve seen which is
totally sold out to god as for cooperation that can always occur unity on the other hand may
never occur as for those who think about only one church being the true one i remind them that mark states that there are
disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with but they
will not lose their reward as with the boston movement i ve heard
numerous times this exact same thing that there are disciples out there
that are not a part of the boston movement but that does not make them
any less disciples of course few people admit that they ve ever run
into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement i know i haven t i must warn that this sounds cliquey to me a clique is a group which
runs around together to some extent exclusively this causes problems
in fellowship and causes divisions i would not say at all that this is
something correct for a church group to do for any reason in one of
the churches i attended for example there was an internal clique of
people who were on the different groups committees organizational
heads of the congregation they rarely talked to anyone else outside of
the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another
office being opened up so that they would have to step right back in their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came he
nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch i wish he
would ve since they still have no clue about what it means to be a
disciple anyway this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be
broken down but is still there so i must warn against such division
within there s enough division without joe fisher"

understand these weirdos and nutcases with the same respect and love
you would expect others to show your notions we are commanded to
love one another after all and brown s book is in fact a heroic
attempt to see the groupings he talks about as motivated in love and
the gospel and their social contexts if anything brown is too heroic here he manages to overstrain himself at times i don t suggest that we follow any of these old cult paths and
it raises hard questions from the skeptic inside me that so much of
early christianity was like the weird christian and non christian cults we see today to that extent i think you raise a serious
problem and perhaps your phrasing is implicitly self deprecatory

love for those we do not understand and it helps to work at under standing as long as we do not get overwhelmed by revulsion and begin
to withdraw our respect for them as people i would advise in other

of foucault s books on sexuality in the ancient world humanity is weird we have known one sane person and we killed him fortunately for us this has proved a comedy rather than a tragedy easter yes this is a tad early our vigil service here has been moved forward

has been caused by the secular worldview or by the humanist
worldview and especially by the secular humanist worldview this is not to say that all secular humanists are necessarily avid
destroyers of the environment and i am sure that there are many who
are concerned about the environment but at the time of the
renaissance and ref ormation in western europe man became the centre or the focus of culture hence humanism this consciousness was
also secular in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the
present age r ather than the age to come capitalism arose at the
same time and the power of economics became central in philosophy this doesn t mean that economics did not exist before simply that it
began to dominate the conscious cultural values of western european
society and its offshoots this cultural shift was in its later
stages accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that
justified them there was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of economics from the christian view of man as the economos the steward of
creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces
and powers there were denominational differences among the new
worshippers of mammon for some the name of the deity was the free
rein of the market mechanism while for others it was the
dialectical forces of history but in both the capitalist west and
the socialist east the environment was sacrificed on the altar of
mammon the situation was mitigated in the west because thos e who

will do even greater things than these because i am going to the

bring glory to the father you may ask me for anything in my name and
i will do it john so jesus asked them to pray for things in his name since that time the request has been the same not to ask for intercession from other
beings but from jesus remember that there is one god and one
mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself as
a ransom for all men the testimony given in its proper time timothy also there have been many of those priests talking
about priests among the hebrews since death prevented them from
continuing in office but because jesus lives forever he has a
permanent priesthood therefore he is able to save completely those who
come to god through him because he always lives to intercede for them hebrews hebrews is also full of areas talking about jesus
being our mediator rather than any other man joe fisher the people before jesus didn t have jesus right may not be as
obvious as you think in what sense to you mean didn t have christian thought has generally said that they had jesus in the sense
that they were saved by his death god is not bound by our

to mock and to scourge and to crucify him and the third day he shall rise again matthew wholly different from the normal experience of men jesus who had never done anything worthy of death even deserving reproval knew he would die before he was years of age he knew the very city where he would die he knew that the religious leaders of his own race would condemn him to death he knew that one of his own would betray him he knew that before his actual death took place he would be mocked and scourged he knew exactly how he would die by crucifixion all this is in itself remarkable but more amazing than the minute particulars of his foreknowledge was what he predicted would follow shortly after he was buried that he would rise again he even designated the time on the third day but since it is on this central fact the death and resurrec tion of jesus christ that the whole truth or untruth of chris tianity turns let us examine it more closely the body of jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed the body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used and a great stone was rolled against the entrance the jewish authorities fully aware that jesus had predicted he would rise again had the stone officially sealed and on saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body early sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body to their utter astonishment they found the stone rolled away the body gone they rushed back to tell the disciples shortly two of jesus friends peter and john utterly skeptical about the whole affair came and found the tomb empty just as the women had said even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone matthew how did this tomb become empty one of the most famous new testament scholars in america professor of new testament literature in a large theological seminary wrote to the author in answer to my question of how the tomb became empty and wrote it in a letter not marked by bitterness or sarcasm that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how santa claus comes down the chimney at christmas time but he didn t realize that santa clause never did come down any chimney at christmas time because there never was a santa claus and there is a jesus he died he was buried in the tomb of joseph of arimathea and on sunday the body was gone those are facts of history no one can escape the responsi bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old another professor dr kirsopp lake of harvard university tried to explain the empty tomb by saying what no other scholar in the field of new testament criticism has ventured to adopt that the women went to the wrong tomb the facts are these first so far as we know there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone second it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days even if the women did miss the tomb when peter and john came did they too go to the wrong tomb third were the soldiers guarding the wrong tomb there is of course a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the new testament itself now when they were going behold some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done and when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel they gave large money unto the soldiers saying say ye his disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept and if this come to the governor s ears we will persuade him and secure you so they took the money and did as they were taught and this saying is com monly reported among the jews until this day matthew this is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty you will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb was empty they never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true they knew it was true another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty the soldiers were told to say that jesus disciples came and stole the body away while they the soldiers were asleep how could they know what was going on while they were asleep obviously such testimony would be valueless in any court even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of jesus first as professor heffern points out the leaders of judaism in jerusalem who had put the lord jesus to death had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach jesus and his resurrection because all jerusalem knew the tomb was empty if there had been trickery here sooner or later it would have been suspected then proved second surely one of the disciples even most of them would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent it may be possible to live a lie but men seldom die for a lie and most of these men did the result ultimately would have been that the message that christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories it would have lost it power instead this truth swept the world closed pagan temples won millions of disciples brought hope to a despairing humanity was the very foundation truth of the early church and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever but not only did jesus come alive again he did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to him instead he appeared to them literally visibly frequently he appeared to the women at the tomb on resurrection morning matthew later that day to mary magdalene alone john and to simon peter also alone luke in the afternoon he walked with two of his followers toward emmaus luke and that night he appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at jerusalem mark luke etc a week later he appeared to all eleven of the apostles probably at the same place john once he was seen by above brethren on a mountain in galilee i corinthians and finally to the apostles just before his ascension mark luke acts as with the fact of the empty tomb so in regard to these histor ically recorded appearances all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness but these theories are unreasonable without supporting evidence none has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances moreover while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle increase mather president of harvard timothy dwight president of yale nathan lord president of dartmouth edward hitchcock president of amherst mark hopkins president of williams john witherspoon president of princeton these men and countless others have believed it but suppose christ did rise from the dead what of it what has it to do with my life what has it to do with your life just this it seals with certitude the teachings of christ jesus taught many great truths especially many about himself he claimed to have come down from god he said he was the way to god he said he was the son of god who alone knew god perfectly he said that whoever believed on him had eternal life and no one else had it he said that whatever we ask god in his name he would grant it to us thus when he did rise from the grave on the third day he revealed that in these amazing unparalleled predictions he spoke the truth do you know any reason any good reason why we should not believe that his words are all true the point is does not the truth of the resurrection convince us that he is none other than the one he claimed to be the son of god and then of course the fact that christ rose from the dead testifies that he has broken the power of death and that he will some day raise us also up from the grave as he promised in other words if this person jesus christ the son of god in all this he should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life for he said a life built on him would know forgiveness of sins his compan ionship and help a joy that no circumstances can ever take away and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day those who have tried it down through the ages and there have been many have given their testimony and we today who believe also know

respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations this
doesn t mean that environmentalism is wrong any more than supporting peace in
the middle east is wrong because jews and muslims also work for it nonetheless paganism is certainly on the rise and we as christians should
address this and look at what draws people from paganism to christianity like
it or not pagan religions are addressing needs that christianity should be and isn t i believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that christianity has
forgotten this doesn t mean that paganism is right but it does mean that we
have something to learn from the pagan movement first paganism respects the feminine christianity has a long history of
oppressing women and many if not most male christians are still unable to
live in a non sexist manner the idea that god is sexless or that christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission is met with a great
deal of resistance this insistance on a male dominated theology and the male dominated society that goes with it drives away many young women who have
had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches second paganism respects the physical world this is an idea with great
ramifications one of these is environmentalism respect for our surroundings
and our world another is integration of sexuality christianity has a long
tradition of calling all sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress
and deny their sexuality this is too much sex is clearly a part of human
experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic and paganism
is an attractive option i m not advocating that christian doctrines no sex before marriage etc should be changed just that christians work toward a more moderate ethic of
sexuality denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated
sexuality and neither one does much to bring us closer to god alan terlep incestuous vituperousness oakland university rochester mi melissa eggertsen

belief that their faith is total truth according to them their beliefs come from the bible and the bible is the word of
god and god is truth thus they know the truth this stance
makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own
hesitations about christianity because they see no other way their way is the truth but i see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe
a particular way that choice is part faith and part reason but it seems to me a choice my discussions with some christians remind me of schoolyard
discussions when i was in grade school a kid would say all policemen are jerks i d ask how do
you know because my daddy told me so how do you know

not healthy so i rely one the one who can see hear and
taste everything and knows what is real and what is not that is god of course you may ask if i cannot trust my own senses how do i know whether what i see and hear about god is truth or
a lie that is why we need faith to be saved we must force
ourselves to believe that god knows the truth and loves us
enough to share it with us even when it defies what we think
we know why would he have created us if he did not love us enough to help us through this world i also do trust my experiences to some extent when
i do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience because it is what my father commands me to do and i see
the results in the long term i find that he has led me
in the proper direction even though it did not feel right
at the time this is where our works as christians are
important as exercises of the body make the body strong excercises of faith make the faith strong as for you no one can convert you you must
choose to follow god of your own will if you are ever to
follow him all we as christians wish to do is share with
you the love we have received from god if you reject that we have to accept your decision although we always keep
the offer open to you if you really want to find out
why we believe what we believe i can only suggest you try
praying for faith reading the bible and asking christians
about their experiences personally then you may grow to

describe the situation which plagues me i am a divorced father chance would have it that my weekend with my daughter has fallen upon easter weekend this year although i am presbyterian i had married a catholic woman we decided
that the catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith
was too confining and restrictive due to time as we had already set a
date and we were married in a christian church which was non denominational during the years of our marriage we did not often attend church when our daughter was born some years later my wife insisted that she be baptised as catholic this wasn t a problem with me during a separation of five years my ex wife was taken ill with a disease
that affected her mental capacities she was confined to a mental ward for
two months before it was diagnosed it has since been treated effectively in other words professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society during the recuperation my ex wife has embraced buddism her influence over
my daughter has been substantial and has primarily allowed me only saturday
visitation for a number of years during this period i have read bible study
books to my daughter and tried to keep her aware of her christian heritage last fall our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings at that time i was awarded visitation rights every other weekend at that time i started taking my daughter to church quite often although not every weekend i did this to attempt to strengthen the christian ethic and expose her to a
religious community today easter sunday i took my daughter to church when it came time for communion my daughter took the bread the body of christ but left the wine the blood of christ professing that she was too young for wine she then
balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the
pew in front of us i feel this was a slap in the face to me my religion and an afront to her
religious heritage it can be construed as breaking several of the commandments
if you try i really felt dishonored by the action my daughter is only nine years old but i think she should have been old and
mature enough to realize her actions i have difficulty blaming her directly
for religious teachings her mother swears to but when i discussed this with
my daughter she made it clear she believed in buddhism and not christianity my initial response of anger moderated was to suggest if there is no faith
in christ then why does she celebrate easter or christmas i suggested i
would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays
with her again i do not want to drive her from the fold and would be willing to allow her
to continue practicing buddhism as though i had a choice seeing her only
for two days out of fourteen but i want her to want to embrace christianity any suggestions if you have a response please e mail me a copy i m not a regular reader

submission on the same topic which i submitted a few minutes ago i think we need to distinguish etymology from meaning regardless of

of jesus christ the meaning of a word is only what people understand it to mean and the same goes for other cultural practices the festival of easter
may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival but today there are as far as i know no christians who intend to
honor any kind of pagan goddess by celebrating easter it is nonsense to say this word or this practice really means so and so even though nobody realizes it words and practices don t mean

20565.eml,soc.religion.christian,"the problems with catholic liturgy are likely to continue for
some time the problem is in a nutshell this the liturgy is a
symbolic action in other words catholics do or should believe that
the signs during the mass water blessings vestments altar relics etc are real that is the sprinkling of water bestows real almost tangible holiness the vestments are a real indication of real
sacred time the point of a symbol is that it is understood by all
to be connected to an underlying real referent this kind of thinking
precludes analysis holy water is not holy because of anything it
simply is holy but modern westerners find it extremely difficult especially if
well educated to think of the mass as a symbol we are more likely
to see it as a sign ie an action that represents grace but which
could be replaced with other signs in concrete terms this means the
mass has become a commercial for god s grace rather than the real
thing you can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn t
dare with the real thing ask coca cola co these attitudes have
been encouraged by liturgy workshops etc which instead of focusing
on how to do do liturgy have focused on how to create a meaning in
liturgy you can only create signs symbols have to come from god or
the heart or somewhere deeper than analysis the most dramatic
example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of
the sacred species the consecrated host and wine now with pita
bread etc it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered
in particles if the host is a sign of grace this isnt and issue but
catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real
desacration of the real symbol of jesus body modern catholic liturgy is caught in this epistemological shift we
try to perfrom the old rites but then we have some liturgomaniac
priest get up and explain what we are doing so we stop doing it and
start pretending to do it this is not a soul filling experience it doesn t help btw that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and
three chord ersatz folk music again a result of mis analysis complicated
tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones this was the
genius of wesley and the c anglican hymn writers taize is only
slightly better what are we to do well i suggest rejecting the parish system if it
doesn t work for you search out a church where the liturgy is well
prepared not well explained they exist in every city this is not btw
a matter of particular style the music might be old or new it is
the attitude of the church that counts also note that a conservative
liturgy harking back to pre vatican ii days does not necessarily mean
the church will be socially conservative in nyc i can recommend corpus christi w st st corpus christi w st st very conservative liturgy st joseph s greenwich village modern clean largely gay oratorian church brooklyn very beautiful avoid anywhere anytime a church with electric candles happy easter christos aneste christos voskrezhne christ is risen paul halsall"

20567.eml,soc.religion.christian,"hmmm people in the americas before the time of christ children who

something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness at the very least i think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe
they re going to hell they believe they re going to die understand
that you ve turned hell into a verb using the same logic it also follows
that all animals are going to hell are you sure this is what you want
to say presumably animals don t have the opportunity to get to heaven but this still doesn t change the fact that they re going to hell die
a final death i don t claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of some sort but if hell is as you described final death and
not eternal perpetuation of consciousness it will be true that
there will never be a moment when i am aware of my non existence assuming i go to hell and not to heaven in other words i ll
never know i m dead hmmm ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill and has died at least she s not suffering any more she s in heaven now consider the following statement at least she s not suffering any more she s in hell now the above statement sounds odd but according to your definition of hell it would be a true statement the person in hell would not be suffering granted they wouldn t be anything wouldn t be having any
conscious experience whatsoever you say hell death is eternal however this loses its meaning to a dead person and to me it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense has force if one expects to
be conscious throughout this eternity many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the
product of propaganda friend do you want the free gift of e ternal life it s my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife can anyone back me up on this combined with the survival instinct all
animals share the difference is we have consciousness and once we get the
idea of eternal life drilled into our brains we then desire a sort of
super survival that would depend on what heaven is like if god is a king and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the king i might opt for hell i read a lovely account of a missionary trying to

that there are indeed absolutes in the universe so people sometimes disagree about what is true this does not negate
the fact however that there are still absolutes in the universe moreover evangelical christianity at least still professes to believe in certain

that christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god when the

20574.eml,soc.religion.christian,one interpretation i ve heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one s wife the husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her he must honor her as his sister in christ this would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer this verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is god s will for his family without consulting his wife god reveals his will to both the husband and the wife there needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making even those whose understanding of the bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family one way to look at it is that god speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife jayne kulikauskas
20575.eml,soc.religion.christian,"eric damien was presenting his views on christianity i ll
respond to a few of his points this is certainly a valid objection to religion as explanation of nature fortunately for the convenience of us believers there is a class of
questions that can never be reduced away by natural science for
example why does the universe exist at all after all the time space
world didn t have to exist why does anything exist and is it
possible for persons e g man to come into being out of a purely
impersonal cosmos these questions which look at the real mysteries of
life the creation of the world and of persons provide a permanent
indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be
found outside that world in its source when you say that man is only an animal i have to think that you are
presenting an unprovable statement a dogma if you will and one
the requires a kind of faith too by taking such a hard line in
your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own but before you write off all christianity as phony and shallow i hope
you ll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by
reading paul johnson s a history of christianity from your remarks it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian
religion and not others even an atheist should have enough faith in
man to know that a movement of years has to have some depth and
be animated by some enduring values with best wishes"
20576.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i m not surprised that you see no wisdom in them that is because your
premises are wrong from the word go you claim that christianity is
based on blind faith but this simply is not so just look at the
current thread on the evidence for jesus resurrection for evidence
that jesus was real and that he triumphed over death furthermore you say that christians hold to their beliefs regardless of
any evidence that you may find to the contrary without any evidence
to support your claim this statement is little more than an ad hominem argument mind you i don t mean this as a personal attack i m merely pointing out
the intellectual dishonesty behind condemning christianity in this fashion it would make much more sense if you could prove that all christians do base their belief on empty nothings and that they do ignore all evidence to the contrary only then can you expect your attack to make sense"

a result of his passion for fast motorcycles i might say his mother
predicted he would die of course his father may have said he ll
make good money because of his hobby and depending upon the final
outcome of the situation i end up mentioning the one that s

a casual statement finally on prophesies note that there are many prophesies that can be
fulfilled my people often to fool believers if i say beware the

it off or have someone come out from another room and do it there was
no prediction a similar situation arises with the establishment of
the jewish state while pressing for it prominent jews argued that it
was predicted that they d have a state again and that the time has
come i ve read this somewhere but can t think of the source if
you can please let me know in this case the establishment of the

20579.eml,soc.religion.christian,"in a previous article pixie says well despite what my mother told me about accepting dares here goes you have to be very careful about what you mean by question authority taken literally it is nonsense that which is authoratative is authoratative and to say i question to word of this authority is ridiculous if it is open to question it isn t an authority on the other hand it is perfectly
reasonable to question whether something is an authority the catch phrase
here should be authenticate authority once you have authenticated
your authority you must believe what it says or you are not treating it as
an authority the difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy you can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency
in what it teaches or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of
discourse but the fact that i cannot discredit something does not in
inself accredit it nor does the fact that i can convince myself and other that i have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false i cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings because if i can independantly verify its teachings i don t need an authority i need an authority only when there is information i need which
i cannot get for myself thus if i am to authenticate an authority i must
do it by some means other than by examining its teachings in practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don t
have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves every scientist
woring today assumes on the authority of the scintific community all sorts
of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself in spiritual matters we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation we select our authorities based on various criteria i am
a catholic in part because the historical claims of the rc church seem
the strongest without authorities there would be no subject matter for
belief unless we simply made something up for ourselves as many do the atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities this is a
reasonable assertion in itself but it leads to a practical difficulty if you reject all authority out of hand you reject all possibility of
every receiving information thus the atheist position can never possibly
change it is non falsifiable and therefore unscintific to demand scintific or rational proof of god s existence is to deny
god s existence since neither science nor reason can in their very
nature prove anything"

therefore it is appropriate that we retain the role of the crowd but
to no avail as a member of a liturgy committee i can tell you that the problem
is certain people dominating who want to try out all kinds of
innovations the priests don t seem even to want to make any
decisions of their own in many cases i guess it s easier to try
something new than it is to refuse to allow it at our parish on holy thursday instead of the priests washing feet who wants to get around people s feet according to one of our
priests the congregation was invited to come up and help wash one

rubrics for this liturgical action i e body of christ amen for receiving communion that they could be i am not responsible for

priest certainly should not have given this part of the mass over to
others and i was so disturbed that i declined to receive communion
that night we aren t required to anyway i instead offered up
prayers for our priests and parish the quality of the mass has not changed again if it were to be
celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the church it would
still be liturgically beautiful the problem comes about from
people trying to be creative who are not i think the answer to your question on participation could be that

20595.eml,soc.religion.christian,"dean velasco quoted a letter from james m stowell president of
moody bible institute there has been a lot of discussion but so far nobody seems to have hit on
exactly what the criticism of arrogance is aimed at the arrogance being attacked is that we think we are the only ones who know
what the absolutes are in short many evangelicals claim that they are
infallible on the matter of religious texts in particular the problem is one of epistemology as a shorthand you can
think of epistemology as how do you know that question it turns out is
a very troubling one the problem with absolute certainty is that at the bottom at least some of
the thinking goes on inside your own head unless you can be certain that
everything which happens in your head is infallible the reasoning you did to
discover a source of truth is in question and that means you do not have absolute justification for your source of
authority which means you do not have absolute certainty let s take the specific example of biblical inerrancy and a fictional
inerrantist named zeke the following arguments applies to the idea of
papal infallibility too zeke has we presume spent some time studying the bible and history and
several other topics he has concluded based on all these studies and
possibly some religious experiences that the bible is a source of absolute
truth he may be correct but even if he is he cannot be certain that he is correct his conclusion depends on how well he studied history he may have made
mistakes and the references he used may have contained mistakes his
conclusion depends on how well he studied the bible he may have made
mistakes his conclusion depends on his own reasoning and he may have made
mistakes noticing a common thread yet everything about his study of the world that he did everything that
happened in his own head is limited by his own thinking no matter what
he does to try and cover his mistakes he can never be certain of his own
infallibility as long as any part of the belief is based on his own
reasoning that belief cannot be considered absolutely certain zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth but that belief
is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it unless he can
say that his own reasoning is flawless his conclusions are in doubt any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on
your own thinking there is no way out of the loop only an infallible
thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs this is easy to demonstrate let s go back to our shorthand method of doing
epistemology how do you know imagine a hypothetical discussion a the bible is a source of absolute truth b how do you know a i studied history and the bible and religious writings and church teachings and came to this conclusion b how do you know you studied history correctly a well i double checked everything b how do you know you double checked correctly a well i compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed b just because some smart guy believes something that doesn t mean it is true how do you know they studied it correctly a and as you see b will eventually get a to the point where he has to say i
can t prove that there are no mistakes and as long as you may have made a
mistake then you cannot be absolutely certain there is no way out of the loop this is where the arrogance of christians arises many people believe
that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the
doctrines of christianity they are implicitly claiming that they are
infallible and that there is no possibility of mistake claiming that you cannot have made a mistake and that your thinking has led
you to a flawless conclusion is pretty arrogant people who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to
find the infallibility of the church by george salmon he is attacking
the idea that the pope can be knowably infallible and he does so very well but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the bible is
knowably inerrant darren f provine at the core of all well founded belief lies belief that is unfounded ludwig wittgenstein"
20596.eml,soc.religion.christian,"perhaps we have different definitions of absolute then to me an absolute is something that is constant across time culture situations etc true in every instance possible do you agree
with this definition i think you do a simple example in the new testament sorry i don t have a bible at work and can t
provide a reference women are instructed to be silent and cover
their heads in church now this is scripture by your definition this is truth and therefore absolute do women in your church speak do they cover their heads if all scripture is absolute truth it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals yet clearly women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads at least this was the case in the evangelical churches i grew up in evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth and there are plenty of other examples can you reconcile this i don t claim that there are no absolutes i think there are very
few though and determining absolutes is difficult but you are claiming that all of scripture is absolute how can you
determine absolutes derived from scripture when you can t agree how
to interpret the scripture it s very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based on your own interpretation is absolute do you deny that your own

20597.eml,soc.religion.christian,"according to what i have read on biblical idioms speaking in x s
name is a standard aramaic hebrew legal idiom for what we today
would call power of attorney a person from jesus culture authorized
to conduct business in john s name had full authority over john s
financial affairs but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to
work only for john s benefit and consonant with john s wishes it was
not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with in john s name it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney
and be operating in good faith note the overlap here between legal
and religious definitions of faith with this cultural background praying in jesus name does not
mandate a particular verbal formula rather it requires that the
petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous fiduciary relationship with jesus and for the purposes of his
kingdom the message of praying in jesus name is thus closely
aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about god s
delegation of kingdom business to his stewards both resources and

usually as a mother it just seemed rather unbalanced to me fortunately my own personal theology which will probably not
fall into line with a lot others recognized god as a being both
without gender and posessing qualities of both genders as being both
a masculine and feminine force it provides a sense of balance i find

20599.eml,soc.religion.christian,"disclaimer throughout this post there are statements and questions which
could easily be interpreted as being sarcastic they are not i have written
this reply in the most even handed manner that i can with no emotions boiling
to the surface as it was written please accept this as a serious attempt to
foster dialog and rest assurred that i make every attempt to make fun of no
one except myself hmmm there are other animals on this planet with advanced mental facilities which have not developed religion as a satisfactory explaination for the unexplained why is this so further it appears that only humans have a need to explain the unexplained why is this so the other animals on this planet including those with advanced mental facilities seem perfectly content in their ignorance i d like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me from your unsupported statement they are humans are animal only religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need not be researched religion was made up by humans to address a perceived need the biological aspect of humans is deified that is all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex needless to say i disagree with your strong opinion and the underlying presuppositions i disagree that christianity is an infectious cult it has certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia that it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is infectious in a derrogatory sense it may be that it provides a workable system for its adherents and i would argue that this is the case i disagree that christianity is a safety blanket which supplants hope and purpose rather it points an individual to the one source of hope and purpose there is nothing hidden about a christian s source for hope and purpose of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose is the apparent loss of control over one s own life the problem or is it something else finally one does not appropriate eternal happiness by following christian moral standards indeed the sole reason for the existance of christianity is because standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections moral standards are merely guides to the christian the real power to moral living is given to the christian in the person of god s spirit heaven is one of two final states that christian doctrine postulates however christians are generally not motivated to live according to christian moral standards by this promised future reward rather they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here and now many christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a priority and rightly so for it was jesus himself who gave this as a priority for his followers however it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood i e preach the word convert at nearly any cost repeat with new convert ad infinitum rather such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while demonstrating the very real benefits of a christian lifestyle this demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non christian to seek out the christian to ask why needless to say such a demonstration is not easily accom plished it takes a radical committment to the person of jesus it does not happen quickly so perseverance on the part of the christian is required and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist it is ineffective with strangers who cannot evaluate the demonstration over time and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being a friend is to gain a conversion as a long time christian nearly years i view with some skep ticism all evangelism programs which incorporate a hurry up attitude pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all because the pressured convert realizes s he was coerced and disavows christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now the bible states that it is the very spirit of god which brings conviction of wrong doing to people i am content to do my part witness and let the spirit do the rest we are far more than animals we sleep eat reproduce and die just as other animals do true but we are also capable of more than this if your personal vision of humanity or of yourself is so limited i can only hope and pray that you will someday find a more expansive view for reflection what animals have the wide variety of performing arts that humans do how is it that humans can learn the language of other humans or animals but that other animals cannot do so how is it that humans can organize themselves in various social structures whereas other animals have only one structure blatant assertion christianity is not physically addictive christianity is not psychologically addictive christianity is not a thing which one snorts ingests shoots up it is a relationship with a living being you might as validly characterize any close knit relationship with this appelation there are jesus freaks who let the emotional aspects of worship and christian living gain and retain the upper hand even so this does not by itself invalidate the foundation from which these things flow guilty by association that christianity which forces itself upon another is not christianity at all you appear to have an amazing certainty about what really happened years ago how did you come by it i cannot accept your conclusion that jesus influence was a sole result of the roman sack of jerusalem in ad he was years gone by this time it strains the bounds of credulity to assert that nothing about jesus life was noteworthy until the sack christianity is having a relationship with jesus

a curve does he cheat that is interesting not to mention thought
provoking my own concept is that he is a father and we are his

until we are with him the bible says that he looks on the heart as the
final measure from that perspective in a grading context the heart is
the final test specifically most christians would agree that there is only one heaven
and one hell from that perspective it is heaven or hell you either go
to one or the other the grading on a pass fail basis is done by god
the father with intervention by jesus the son not by others for only
god sees the heart the bible says of the heart who can know it i
would say there has always been and always be an unchanging method that is what makes a relationship with christ so secure in an uncertain

are all children some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair but

the best for his own there maybe decipline but there is more love it s sometimes looks like christianity is a test to see who makes it

the objection to celebration of the pagan whore goddess when phrased
that way i suspect or at least i would hope that it becomes immeadiately
apparent what my objection to celebrating her would be no you are thinking perhaps of ressurection sunday i think though i m not too crazy about the word sunday but i certainly like
this phrasing much better than envoking the name of the whore goddess for that matter stay biblical and call it omar rasheet the feast of
first fruits torah commands that this be observed on the day following
the sabbath of passover week sunday by any other name in modern
parlance why is there so much objection to observing the resurrection
on the st day of the week on which it actually occured why jump it all
over the calendar the way easter does why not just go with the sunday
following passover the way the bible has it why seek after unbiblical
methods so what does this question have to do with easter the whore
goddess i am all for celebrating the resurrection just keep that
whore out of the discussion yes i have heard of your newspapers speaking of the need to repave
streets with afro canadiantop i still think blacktop sounds
better though fine by me and while we are at it the left handed people are
both sinister and gauche so we probably will have some objections from
that quarter as well yes that sounds much better to me is there anyone out there would
thinks that phrasing sounds worse read the letter to philemon now tell me was philemon s slave returned to him were there different rules upon the slave than upon
philemon how about male and female are there different rules that
apply to them as well or if there is no more male and female can adam

own experience demonstrates that the meaning of a word is bound up with

of these quotations are of people who do beleive people who would
try to justify their own positions second the logical proof the period of time that has elapsed from the event growing larger
does not increase the odds that a hoax would be discovered in fact
the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes finally there is no proof of the resurrection of christ except in our spirits
communion with his and the father s it is a matter of faith belief
without logical proof incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for

exactly what jesus paul and company were trying to say is not always so
easy i don t believe that paul was trying to say that all women should
behave that way rather he was trying to say that under the circumstances
at the time the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and
cover their heads this has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward
others remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived
from absolutes for instance it is absolutely right for christians to
strive for peace however this does not rule out trying to maintain world
peace by resorting to violence on occasion yes my opinion sure the bible preaches absolute truths however exactly what those
truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion as i said the bible does
preach absolute truths sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal
clear at least to evangelicals sometimes they are not so clear to
everyone e g should baptism be by full immersion or not etc that is
largely because sometimes it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers
are speaking to a particular culture or to christianity as a whole this is where scholarship and the study of biblical contexts comes in god revealed his truths to the world through his word it is utterly unavoidable however that some people whill come up with alternate interpretations practically anything can be misinterpreted especially

get some or make some no free gifts of meaning i never quite understood how any
god can just give your life meaning actually if he
says you exists to do or be x that gives you a purpose
if you care to accept it but is that the same thing but

it or purposefull so you can live it to get something done one should

am threatened by science or even that i am threatened at all although i admit the latter the reason i am threatened by science
has nothing to do with my need for proof of my lord s existence god reveals himself in many ways including to some degree science my problem with science is that often it allows us to
assume we know what is best for ourselves god endowed us
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations for example but he did not make that availible to everyone does that mean that if science can over ride god s decision
through alterations that god wills for us to have the power
to decide who should and should not be able to have children should men be allowed to have babies if that
is made possible people have always had the ability to end lives
unnaturally and soon may have the ability to bring lives
into the world unnaturally the closest thing to artificially
created life is artificially created death and as god
has reserved judgement about when people should die to
himself i believe we should rely on god s wisdom about how
people should be brought in to the world this is not to say that i reject all forms of
medical treatment however treatment that alleviates
pain or prevents pain from occuring is perfectly
acceptable i believe as it was acceptable for jesus
to cure the sick however treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason or makes unnecessary alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes go too far are we not happy with the beauty god
gave us i cannot draw a solid line regarding where i
would approve of scientific study and where i would not but i will say this before one experiments with the
universe to find out all its secrets one should ask
why they want this knowledge before one alters the body
they have been given they should ask themseles why their
body is not satisfactory too them as it is i cannot
make any general rules that will cover all the cases but
i will say that each person should pray for guidance

should cease their unravelling if they have reason to believe their search is displeasing to god malcusco"

20626.eml,soc.religion.christian,"i agree with carol here determining absolutes is practically speaking a
waste of time and we easily forget that relative truth is in fact relative for example i recently was asking some children the question what temperature
does water boil at i got the answer degrees consistently i asked
if they knew what scale and was told it s just degrees any scale that s what all thermometers say well that s sincere and may be
true in the experience of the speaker but it is simply wrong it is not
an absolute truth similarly scripture is full of truth which we should
nurture and cherish but trying to determine which parts are absolute truth
and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time
and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point then religion
easily becomes an intellectual head trip devoid of the living experience of the indwelling trinity and becomes dead scholasticism imo example of head covering in church deleted this was a good example there may be an absolute truth behind the
writing but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the
instructions apply to the corinthians and not necessarily elsewhere the instructions may reflect absolute truth in the context of first
century culture and the particular climate at corinth which was having
a lot of trouble with order is it absolute truth to me no and i see no compelling or even reasonable reason that it should be even the most die hard literalists do not take all of the bible literally i ve yet to meet anyone who takes the verse blessed is he who takes your
babies and smashes their heads against the rocks literally the bible
was not printed or handed to us by god with color codings to tell us
what parts should be interpreted which way i agree very few and even if we knew them personally we may not be able to express that in a way that still conveys absolute truth to another the presence of absence of absolutes may not make any difference since i
know i can never fully apprehend an absolute if it walks up and greets me i can t prove the existence of absolutes i can only rely upon my experience i also trust god s revelation that we cannot fully comprehend the infinite therefore we can t comprehend the absolutes so i don t need them i can never know the essence of god only the energies by and through which
god is manifested to god s creation so the reality can be that there are
absolutes but it is of no practical importance it s like claiming that the
original scriptural autographs were perfect but copies may not be swell who cares it doesn t affect me in any practical useful way i might as well believe that god has made a lot of electric blue chickens and that they
live on mars maybe god did so what is that going to have any effect on how i deal with my neighbor or god whether or not i go to this or that
cafeteria for lunch no this attitude leads many non christians to believe that all christians
are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning christianity is true wonderful and sensible it appeals to reason since reason is an inner
reflection of the logos of god explanations that violate that simply
appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world note i m not claiming there is no place for authority that d be silly there is a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that and is generally agressive good parents like god are authoritative many christians are simply authoritarian and not surprisingly few adults respond to this treatment larry overacker"

true of something outside of nature i e super natural it may be that one day man not only can create life but can also create man now i don t see this happening in my lifetime nor do i assert it is probable but the possibility is there given scientists are working hard at decoding out genetic code to perhaps help cure disease of a genetic variation again though must there be why or a divine prupose to man s existence i believe the genetic code will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining reproducing life ever i ve never been much of a prophet though i

having all of the parts available just my opinion when you say that man is only an animal i have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement a dogma if you will and one the requires a kind of faith too by taking such a hard line in your atheism you may have stumbled into a religion of your own as far as we can tell man falls into the mammal catagory now that preposition sort of precludes an absolute doesn t it without an absolute conclusion what are we left with i believe the word faith works nicely if there were something more to the man say a soul then we have yet to find evidence of such but as it is now man is a mammal babies are born live mother gives milk we re warm blooded etc as other mammals are and is similar in genetic construction to some of them in particular primates for more on this check out talk origins but before you write off all christianity as phony and shallow i hope you ll do a little research into its history and varieties perhaps by reading paul johnson s a history of christianity from your remarks it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of christian religion and not others even an atheist should have enough faith in man to know that a movement of years has to have some depth and be animated by some enduring values well then buddhism confucianism taoism hinduism judaism zoerasterism shintoism and islam should fit this bit of logic quite nicely all have depth all have enduring values thus all must be true well then with an equal scale and under an equal standard investigate
them all and discover where god is or whether he is for the denial of
god is ultimately a statement of faith non falsifiable as his existence may be for isn t this the purpose of religion to discover and in discovery to know god you don t mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your

the attacker there were cases of civilians killing their attacker in self defence but such cases represent less that of the crimes prevented by armed self defence for every
case you cite there were over other cases of self defence
where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed by the way is the most conservative possible figure based on the national crime survey s estimate of crimes prevented by armed self defence each year most other studies on the subject put the figure at to those figures would imply less than of sucessful self defences
involve killing the attacker so more correctly there over possibly as many as cases of civilians acting in self defence only of which resulted
in the death of the attacker this is a significant factor in

53322.eml,talk.politics.guns,"no the issue is reducing crime not guns if gun control doesn t
lower crime overall then is doesn t address the issue does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much
more common muggers using a gun rely primarily on the
threat of the gun and rarely shoot their victim a mugger
using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim in an effort incapacitate him so while a knif may not
be as deadly as a gun criminals are more likely to actually use the knife as opposed to threatening the victim with it it isn t at all clear that replacing the criminal s gun with a
knife would reduce murders stabbings might just become more
common that s why it is important to look at the overall not the with gun homicide rate it avoids the issue of
substitution different criminal techinques of using different
weapons etc and measures what we want to prevent murders face possibly however facing knife welding attackers isn t
too common stabbing without warning and by supprise is the
usual tactic very few criminals shoot from cover it attracts
to much attention and they don t have a chance to go through your
pockets overall i d much rather be threatened with a gun
than actually stabbed with a knife actually the exact same statement is true of guns training in
unarmed self defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman without much problem you also ignore the criminal s reaction the national crime
survey clearly shows that criminals unarmed armed with a
knife gun or whatever are unwilling to risk their lives
in a confrontation if faced with a serious threat almost
all prefer to leave and find an easier target therefore using or threatening to use as is much more commonly the case a weapon is the best defence against an attacker regardless
of how he is armed knives however are much less effective

there would be no net positive effect you also have to consider the negative side law abiding citizens armed with fireamrs pistols for the most part prevent between national crime survey and dr kleck crimes
each year those are the extremes most studies find
the number to be to about of those crimes are
homicides so private ownership of firearms saves approximately lives each year there are roughly criminal homicides
and fatal accidents involving guns each year for there to be any net benefit you would have to show that gun control measures
would disarm over of the criminals currently using guns that would be very hard to do according the the federal batf only of criminals buy their guns over the counter since
gun control laws by their very nature only effect legal
sales such a law would remove all the benefits of armed law abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on
armed criminals who by and large get their guns illegally that doesn t sound like a net benefit to me since most were with licensed weapons i assume you are not
supporting reasonable laws i e waiting periods background

themselves and their community if you look at the american revolution as an example the militias won by seperating themselves
from and becoming independent of a repressive government they
didn t overthrow it and those communities canada and england for example that didn t defend themselves were still under that same
old regime if the role of the militia were offensive to go out and
destroy repressive governments nuclear weapons might be appropriate but their jobs is defensive and nuclear weapons aren t suited
for that there is also the question of personal and collective arms the
second amendment definately protects ownership of personal
weapons since the very nature of the militia requires members
to provide their own arms but it isn t clear if it covers
other arms certainly not all members would supply for example a tank only a few could or if they were to be used effectively should however those providing the heavy weapons have a disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower the militias as the framers envisioned them were extremely
democratic if only of the members supported the cause only would respond to a muster and the militia s firepower would
be proportionately reduced militia firepower and the popular
will were therefore linked but if a small minority of the
members supplied a large fraction of the firepower in the
form of heavy weapons this would all change the militia s
firepower would depend on the will of a small minority not
of the general public worse that minority would be quite
different from the general public at the very least they
would be much richer as a result i think the nature and

has been whether they fired their main guns you did not merely claim that
tanks were used you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress
sniper fire and that they were quite effective at this you continue to
back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is
disputing awesley went on i spent a few minutes in a library today found their computer was down and they don t have a card catalog anyway it took about minutes to find this in nightmare in detroit a rebellion and it s victims by sauter and hines on page telling of the death of tonia blanding age when the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction the shots came from the fifty caliber machine gun mounted on the tank belched fire into the buildings after a short round into the front of the buildings the tank guns spit again tearing apart huge holes out of the side of the apartment well it s not the main gun well it s not the main gun gee that s only the entire point are you

read the reports of the tank fire i ll bet you dollar to doughnuts i won t it will take more than second hand accounts from a few old national guard sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled american cities in the sixties awesley replied well if you bothered to read them it wouldn t take long at all to find reports of tank fire although not necessarily of the main guns i will never read of tanks firing their main guns in detroit in the riots there is simply no way that such an event could have taken place

military firing shells from tanks in american cities on blacks would have

it or would your bullshit filters kick in if tanks had fired their main guns in detroit people would have been

faster rate of fire is usually not desirable sure it makes the other
guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson
in hose mode this is why the military is limiting it s m now to round burst fire simple semi auto would be better but the troops
like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something
often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful a revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same caliber a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again a double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the trigger a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round a revolver can be carried with the th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one handed speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi autos can be faster depending on users a misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it s jammed before starting to do anything about clearing it most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged i do not consider this safe however you must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver there are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training some police departments switched to glocks and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers too many were having
accidents partly due to the poor training they received not that glocks
require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a vcr anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
the police don t know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter
and pay attention i do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid a cop
with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
equipped for anything short of a riot gun control is hitting what you aim at if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit i own a mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
to something like the ruger security six revolver if i haven t hit
what i m aiming at in the first shots something is quite seriously
wrong somewheres while i might like having the backup capacity of those
extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in
criminal encounters is less than what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier magnum but anyway obplea don t flame me i prefer semi autos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal"

that i know about a glock is the lack of a real safety on it sure there is
that little thing in the trigger but that isn t too great of a safety actually i don t watch those shows and you re right at least partially i don t know much about handguns i m more familiar with rifles no flames here all your points are well taken guess i still have a

in australia do not in any way support the cost effectiveness of this
approach it may be cost effective for deer if you quietly overlook
the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is negative i e a profit because the majority of hunters pay for licences the cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have
to be employed to cull the animals which is not in fact the case you figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive
pellets or spread baits there has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the governor general s residence has now reached plague proportions despite the
whines of the rampant animal libbers the most effective method of
controlling the population is still considered to be controlled

ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking either that or this
is sour grapes because we beat you in the olympic shooting events funny you d think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse precisely that makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry not everybody has the time to train with a gladius you know but for
some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time to
extend this a bit further you need only a certain level of competence
to beat another with a range weapon getting in their face with a
weapon and winning is much more difficult and requires more training
time the average citizen just does not have i ve spent a few years
practicing with a sword i can take the common person armed with one though self defense isn t the reason i own one my kid sister would
have an even chance of beating me gun vs gun with only a month of
training that makes firearms much better in our eyes excellent point perhaps you aren t so naive after all taken into consideration in what respect though quite wrong let s
make it a blanket statement for weapons in general this has been
taken into consideration we call use of them aggrivated assault assault with a deadly weapon assault with intent to kill attempted
murder and a whole host of others and tack on extra prison time in norway i suspect it was about the only weapon available you conquered
your land among others a full millenia before we were thought of and
shortly thereafter weapons weren t quite so common i suspect that a few
world wars made a difference too since in times of emergency weapons
tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes i m curious though were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime or
were they aquired by other means any requirements other than just
registering the shotgun come on down to honest erik s used swords here s a slightly used
short sword the battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh
century only with trade in easy financing sorry i
couldn t resist you guys still slicing each other with long knives or is this really not a problem i m all for that what gets me is that scandanavians and yes i m only
a couple generations off the longship used to be some of the most
feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago yet now seem to
spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing maybe you had a bit more time and a more homogeneous culture to become
civilized with yes we re too damned violent partially i believe because we are not
a homogeneous culture and don t identify ourselves as americans first
and foremost i m rather proud of my norwegian and danish heritage whereas i suspect you couldn t care less about that welsh blood in
your veins thanks to a raid in ireland back in the time scale
and the homogeneous culture are important equally important is a
basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good in america the individual is more important than the masses personal
liberties are prized above all this is sadly changing of late but
i trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict
individuals for little collective benefit hateful to americans i d
hazard a guess that were america less interested in freedom and
personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would
have sent our armed forces anywhere one poor effect of this culture
we have is that we re looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy
to identify with only a small segment of the population my grandmother
tells of being discriminated against back in denmark because she spoke low dane whereas others spoke high dane it was shortly after

seen reports of deaths caused by them the british in northern ireland use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the

has its own set of problems it may well take more applications of the

54154.eml,talk.politics.guns,"iftccu talk politics guns strider pm apr i ve been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now even
contributed a few comments but this stuff i d rather face a knife than
a gun has got to come from ignorance i used to think pretty much the
same thing then i got educated people do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be or how
quickly you can be killed with one most people don t understand that
it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick within a minute or so death the death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage
points of each other many people not realizing how deadly knives are try their luck and thus more get injured by knives a gun is deadly
only in a single direction and it s only advantage is that it is a
remote control weapon a contact weapon such as a knife controls a
spherical area to feet in diameter most people have never seen knife wounds aside from slicing a finger by
accident from feet or so a knife is very nearly an even match for
a holstered gun in experienced hands even if the knife wielder has only
moderate skill from inside feet or so a knife is a match for a
drawn gun a knife is utterly silent it never jams and never runs out
of ammunition it is limited only by the speed dexterity skill and
ability of it s wielder criminals in general are young fast and
strong it s interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks
used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled
slashing attacks of novices i ve talked to several well trained
martial artists they have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up
against a knife they simply plan on being cut hopefully not as bad as
the attacker practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment practicing
with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a
knife say a popsicle stick or tooth brush criminals practice their
knife attacks in prison if you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize
these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is
the knife ripping through your throat or in the case of an experienced
attacker parts of your body falling off onto the ground a year old
man with arthritis can close that yard distance and gut you in about
one and a half seconds dennis tueller with a broken leg in a walking
cast managed it in two i ve seen people close that distance and strike
in second i m old over weight and slow i can do it in seconds i ve seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons
that you would not believe how about a single stab wound to the chest
with a table fork in this case the attacker used the handle not the
pointed end add to this the fact that hand gun stopping power is largely a myth except in the case of a central nervous system shot or a round that
destroys the skeletal structure it takes anywhere from to twelve
seconds for a bullet wound to take effect this is true of even heart shots there is the case of the police woman
in l a the first recorded survivor of a shot to the heart that
lady not only killed her attacker but chased him down to do it all
four of her shots fired after she had been shot struck the perp atta
girl the bullet entered her on a downward angle went through the apex
of her heart down through the diaphragm clipped her liver and
destroyed her spleen it then exited her back leaving a tennis ball
sized hole she died about six times on the operating table but was
out of the hospital in days and was back on full duty in eight
months she was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest she was
on her way home so happened to have her gun no she doesn t think
civilians should have the same rights sigh the moral of the story is that even if you do manage to shoot a knife
attacker you d better be planning on doing some dodging a good
alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis people can often walk a little on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor
them many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact
weapons the target is as large as the traditional center of mass and
is more reliable to stop somebody with a contact weapon assuming a
caliber powerful enough to do the job hot s on up will usually
do this remember folks the idea isn t to take em with you but for you to live
and them to fail whatever the consequences for them this the reason killing them isn t our goal or in many cases even good enough to keep
us alive i don t want to face a violent attack of any sort knowing what i now
know i can t rightly say i d rather face a knife than an gun it would
have to depend on the attacker and if i could pick and choose i
wouldn t be there this is really the bottom line criminals do not
fear the law criminals do not fear the weapon they fear the citizen

whatever it takes rick"

own guns the sentence in the second amendment doesn t restrict the right or state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other than the people all it does is make a positive statement regarding a right of the people the people as in you and me as in the first fourth ninth tenth as well as the second amendment the existence of this right is assumed it is not granted by the amendment there is no stated or implied condition relating the right to bear arms to the necessity of a well regulated militia to the security of in other words the entire sentence says that the right to keep and bear arms is unconditional no not unconditional but shall not be infringed infringed
is defined as to break or ignore the terms of or obligations an oath an agreement law or the like to disreguard violate to go beyond the boundaries or limits tresspass encroach this definition implies the following of some form of existing agreement laws and agreements are made in advance boundaries or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole the word unconditional implies no agreements or all previous agreements are off which is the opposite the words used in the first amendment are much stronger i e congress shall make no law are much stronger they clearly imply unconditional if the writers of the amendment wanted unconditional whay didn t they says congress shall make no laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms the second amendment implies a sort contract between the people
the people and the state the bigger part of the contract is
the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws

an anachronism after all laws in made by representatives of the people these representatives of the people have already decided

intentional use thus the glock safety is perfectly adequate from a safety standpoint but not necessarily the most desirable from the
standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else by this criteria it does make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece from the standpoint of police use it is no better or worse than a
revolver as far as being proprietary to the officer in the method of
firing it the ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that
the firearm can t be used by anybody but it s owner but for now the
wide variety of safety systems helps unless the criminal happens to be
familiar with that particular type of firearm rick"
54168.eml,talk.politics.guns,"iftccu talk politics guns vincent fox am apr this isn t rec guns so maybe this is getting a bet technical but i
can t resist sometimes depends on why it misfired i can t imagine doing much combat type shooting single action assuming the cylinder will rotate never hurts to err on the side of safety but if you ve got one of those new fangled hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties it s unnecessarily
redundant i d rather have the extra round quite true speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around
than magazines though true but this is a training function cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions
are the only carry modes that make sense the series colt s for
example are quite safe to carry this way agreed now that i ve shot off my mouth a bit let me back some of this up it
is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn t cost you much on
the other hand i ve had all sorts of interesting things happen over the
years for example i ve had factory ammunition that has had high
primers a high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds
to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem an auto jack the slide and continue i ve had bullets come out of the case keeping the cylinder from
turning see clearing paragraph above about the worst that can happen
with a semi auto is a double feed this can be cleared in seconds most revolvers are more fragile then semi auto s there are all sorts
of close tolerance parts and fitting involved dropping the gun or a
blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action many
of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a quality semi auto
take a gun smith for a revolver in short a revolver may be less likely
to malfunction but as a rule when it does you re out of the fight the majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall
into that category vincint makes many good points in this post but leaves off the opposing
view of most of them a real good starting place is ayoob s the semi
auto pistol for police and self defense in general i d agree the revolver is an excellent first gun and self
defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time and inclination
that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi
auto effectively as a self defense arm most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms if the department
isn t going to train them they aren t going to take the time on their
own there is no doubt that training is an issue the amount of
training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several
times that of a revolver many cops don t bother for myself i d hate to be limited to one or the other i d rather pick
what fits better with my personal inclination what i m wearing that day
and so on like the moderator on rec guns says buy em all that said i have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of
buying their first defense arm is right after taking a class get a
ruger or smith revolver sorry colt fans colt revolvers are ok
too if this post had gone the other way i d be arguing for revolvers rick"

like heart attack and stroke vast is probably too loose a term with approximately americans
using firearms each year over a year period we get roughly since some
may have to do this more than once million americans with experience in using firearms for self defense yields percent of the population yes i know that is a real rough estimate we re closer to million now but many of these are minors and should be included etc thus the percentage
if anything is low at any rate most minority groups in this range are not usually referred to as tiny minorities so i don t see how the other part of the group can be referred to as the vast majority a little more work might support a simple majority of americans never use own or display a firearm certainly when you are talking about ownership you are wrong nearly half

magical than the mexican border which is shorter and far more
heavily patrolled then i really can t accept that argument no there are approximately deaths due to guns in the u s two thirds of which are suicides unfortunately i don t have suicide
rates for norway however this makes the per gun death rate about
half the per car death rate the problem s been humans since before we had stone axes the
fct of the matter is simply this if nobody ever assaulted anybody whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally
irrelevent yet weapons are built i d suggest then that the murderous
impulse in humanity pre dates weapons anyway the bosnians et al have been making an excellent attempt
to kill each other for half a thousand years taking away their guns even
if we could would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality in the u s approximately of murders are commited with firearms with handguns with non handguns the reason i say that guns per se are not the problem is that our non gun rate exceeds most of europe s
countries entire violent crime rate i don t really think we ve got
more knives or fists in any case i think examples of gun control applied to the u s have been abkect failures just like drug prohibition and other forms
of prohibition until you deal with why people are doing what they
are doing you won t solve your problem and if the problem is violent crime you shouldn t concentrate on the tools instead the vast majority of guns is never ever misused on the order of over the entire lifetime of the gun this says to me that
you can t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse the situation is not good in that people fear for their lives but recall the scenes of the store owners during the last riots protecting their shops with guns would it have been better they too lost their livelihoods the problem of poverty and rage in los angeles no it isn t however if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can

you re discussing someone violently assaulting you then it is

simply letting them know you re prepared to shoot them would be enough as it was with the above mentioned store owners of households have some form of firearm usually a long gun that accounts for a level of access for at least million americans firearm ownership is most likely among educated well off whites the

served weaponry a heavy machine gun is crew served is something
both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some
other country against civilians that have at most one shot at a time
light small arms certainly nothing that places the people in or behind
the tank in any real danger molotov coctails a round from a rifle
or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those and snipers too often turn out to be strays from other cops guard army gunfire i don t know about the other people in this group or on the net but
the idea of tanks being used to control civilians in anything that
pretends to be a free society is outrageous when big government feels
it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests even
violent of the citizens that suggests that the government is totally
out of control since that is effectively the government declaring war
on its own people if the government was living up to its responsibility government of the people by the people not the lords and other elites

redressed have been ignored and yes there is a criminal element that
will exploit this but the fact remains that the government has been
unresponsive or such acts wouldn t be apt to happen still not an excuse
to open up on civilians with tanks heavy machine guns or whatever its the old might makes right philosophy that is the hallmark of a
government going rogue they don t like it tough we will simply
squash them under an iron boot actually addressing their grievances

progressive or doesn t fit in with modern thinking anymore unbelievable and i do believe amid the smoke confusion etc of a real riot situation that it would be possible for a tank to get away with firing the main gun
into a building at close range one would hear an explosion among many
explosions it is loud but it is not going to stand out like a pound bomb or a tactical nuke there would be a hole blown in the wall and some rubble but with tanks knocking over walls and other sources
of buildings turning into rubble and other covering racket such as
gunfire including s tacking away it would not stand out that much and could be explained by musta been a gas leak i think it could be
done and not be reported under such conditions it is possible it is
not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a sunday afternoon turning

short lived armenian dictatorship and the architect of the cold blooded genocide of million turks and kurds between an armenian national council was formed by the notorious dashnak party leaders in berlin which was recognized by the nazis encouraged by this the armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed and espoused fully the principles of the nazis and declared themselves as the members of the aryan super race and full participants to hitler s policy of extermination of the jews this armenian nazi conspiracy against the jews during wwii was an encore performance staged by the armenians during wwi when they back stabbed and
exterminated million turks by colluding with the invading russian army furthermore as mccarthy put it the armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the ottomans admitted defeat and signed the mudros
armistice with the allies october the allies had decided
to create a greater armenia including the old russian province
of yerevan and adjoining areas as well as most parts of anatolia
claimed by the armenian fanatics only the area called cilicia around the ottoman province of adana was to be excluded as it
had already been claimed by the french the allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm ottoman soldiers and other turks who
could be expected to oppose their plans on april the british army occupied kars gave civilian
and military power over to the armenians then withdrew the british
planned for kars to be included in the armenian dictatorship even though the russian pre war census had shown kars province to be over muslim the turks of kars were effectively disarmed but the british could not disarm the kurds of the mountains the fate of
the turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in eastern anatolia murder pillage genocide and the destruction
of turkish homes and entire turkish villages drove the turks of
kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the ottoman army the british had left the scene to the armenian genocide squads therefore few europeans were present to observe the genocide one british

really sorry if that fact bothers you more ridicule i take it still not addressing the original points made then what seems to be the problem did you ever read newspaper at all painful search the gruesome extent of february s killings of azeris by armenians
in the town of hojali is at last emerging in azerbaijan about men women and children dead in the worst outrage of the
four year war over nagorny karabakh the figure is drawn from azeri investigators hojali officials
and casualty lists published in the baku press diplomats and aid
workers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates the february attack on hojali by armenian forces was one of
the last moves in their four year campaign to take full control
of nagorny karabakh the subject of a new round of negotiations
in rome on monday the bloodshed was something between a fighting
retreat and a massacre but investigators say that most of the
dead were civilians the awful number of people killed was first
suppressed by the fearful former communist government in baku later it was blurred by armenian denials and grief stricken
azerbaijan s wild and contradictory allegations of up to dead the state prosecuter aydin rasulov the cheif investigator of a man team looking into what azerbaijan calls the hojali
disaster said his figure of people dead was a minimum on
preliminary findings a similar estimate was given by elman
memmedov the mayor of hojali an even higher one was printed in
the baku newspaper ordu in may dead people named and more
than bodies reported unidentified this figure of nearly dead is quoted as official by leila yunusova the new spokeswoman
of the azeri ministry of defence francois zen ruffinen head of delegation of the international
red cross in baku said the muslim imam of the nearby city of
agdam had reported a figure of bodies received at his mosque
from hojali most of them civilians we did not count the
bodies but the figure seems reasonable it is no fantasy mr
zen ruffinen said we have some idea since we gave the body bags
and products to wash the dead mr rasulov endeavours to give an unemotional estimate of the
number of dead in the massacre don t get worked up it will
take several months to get a final figure the year old
lawyer said at his small office mr rasulov knows about these things it took him two years to
reach a firm conclusion that people were killed and wounded when soviet troops and tanks crushed a nationalist
uprising in baku in january those nationalists the popular front finally came to power
three weeks ago and are applying pressure to find out exactly
what happened when hojali an azeri town which lies about miles from the border with armenia fell to the armenians officially people have so far been certified as dead being
the number of people that could be medically examined by the
republic s forensic department this is just a small percentage
of the dead said rafiq youssifov the republic s chief forensic
scientist they were the only bodies brought to us remember the
chaos and the fact that we are muslims and have to wash and bury
our dead within hours of these people were women and were children under years old gunshots killed people shrapnel killed and
axes or blunt instruments killed exposure in the highland
snows killed the last three thirty three people showed signs of
deliberate mutilation including ears noses breasts or penises
cut off and eyes gouged out according to professor youssifov s
report those bodies examined were less than a third of those
believed to have been killed mr rasulov said files from mr rasulov s investigative commission are still
disorganised lists of azeri militiamen are dead here six
policemen there and in handwriting of a mosque attendant the
names of corpses brought to be washed in just one day the
most heartbreaking account from witnesses interviewed so far
comes from towfiq manafov an azeri investigator who took a
helicopter flight over the escape route from hojali on february there were too many bodies of dead and wounded on the ground to
count properly in hojali people by the stream
and the road and visible around nakhchivanik village mr
manafov wrote in a statement countersigned by the helicopter
pilot people waved up to us for help we saw three dead children and
one two year old alive by one dead woman the live one was
pulling at her arm for the mother to get up we tried to land but
armenians started a barrage against our helicopter and we had to
return there has been no consolidation of the lists and figures in
circulation because of the political upheavals of the last few
months and the fact that nobody knows exactly who was in hojali
at the time many inhabitants were displaced from other villages
taken over by armenian forces the independent london heroes who fought on amid the bodies aref sadikov sat quietly in the shade of a cafe bar on the
caspian sea esplanade of baku and showed a line of stitches in
his trousers torn by an armenian bullet as he fled the town of

of the attack some huddled in shelters but others started
fleeing the town down a hill through a stream and through the
snow into a forest on the other side to escape the townspeople had to reach the azeri town of agdam
about miles away they thought they were going to make it until at about dawn they reached a bottleneck between the two
armenian villages of nakhchivanik and saderak none of my group was hurt up to then then we were spotted by
a car on the road and the armenian outposts started opening
fire mr sadikov said azeri militiamen fighting their way out of hojali rushed forward
to force open a corridor for the civilians but their efforts
were mostly in vain mr sadikov said only people from his
group of made it through including his wife and militiaman

though they are all empowered to take necessary measures to

been driven out a part of them now settled in azerbaijan some turkish meskhetians lezghins and representatives of other caucasian nationalities who escaped from the central
asia where the president and government bodies did not guarantee
them the life and peace also suffered from these deportations one of the scandalous vandalisms directed not only against
azerbaijan science but the world civilization as well is the
armenian extremists destruction of the karabakh scientific
experimental base of the institute of genetics and selection of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr we beg you for humanitarian help and political assistance for the honour and dignity of million azerbaijanis are
violated its territory culture and history are trampled its people are shot there is persistent negative image of
azerbaijanians abroad and this defamation is spread over the whole world by soviet mass media armenian lobby in the
ussr and the united states one of the myths is that all events allegedly involves and
generated by interethnic collisions and religious intolerance
while the truth is that all these shootings and recent events stem from the territorial claims of armenia on
azerbaijan it is a well documented fact that before the conflict there
were no frictions between armenians and azerbaijanis on the
issue of karabakh hundreds and thousands armenians placidly

representatives in all government bodies of the azerbaijan

encouraged by moscow and intended to create a new year reich the great armenia by annexing the neighboring lands the world public opinion shed tears to save the whales suffers for penguins dying out in the antarctic continent but what about the lives of seven million human beings if these people are muslims does it mean that they are
less valuable can people be discriminated by their colour of skin or religion by their residence or other
attributes all people are brothers and we appeal to our brothers
for help and understanding this is not the first appeal
of azerbaijan to the world public opinion our previous
appeals were unheard however we still carry the hope
that the truth beyond the russian and armenian propaganda
will one day reveal the extent of our suffering and
stimulate at least as much help and compassion for
azerbaijan as tendered to whales and penguins the committee for people s help to karabakh of the academy of sciences of the azerbaijan ssr but perhaps turkiye should intervene in the affairs of the caucasus

mountain passes but dozen of bodies scattered over the area lent credence to azerbaijani
reports of a massacre scalping reported azerbaijani officials and journalists who flew briefly to the region
by helicopter brought back three dead children with the back of their
heads blown off they said shooting by armenians has prevented them from retrieving more bodies women and children have been scalped said assad faradshev an aide
to nagorno karabakh s azerbaijani governor when we began to pick up bodies they began firing at us the azerbaijani militia chief in agdam rashid mamedov said the bodies
are lying there like flocks of sheep even the fascists did nothing like this truckloads of bodies near agdam on the outskirts of nagorno karabakh a reuters photographer frederique lengaigne said she had seen two trucks filled with azerbaijani

about a conversation with talaat pasha verifying and rationalizing this
ultra national fascist anti armenian mentality the following i have the conviction that as long as a nation does the best for its own interest and succeeds the world admires it and thinks it moral i am ready to die for what i have done and i know i shall die for it these telegrams were entered as unquestioned evidence during the trial of
talaat pasha s assassin soghomon tehlerian the turkish government never
questioned these death march orders until during a time when the world
was again reminded of the genocide of the armenians for reasons known to those who study the psychology of genocide denial the
turkish government and their supporters in crime deny that such orders were
ever issued and further claim that these telegrams were forgeries based on a
study by s orel and s yuca of the turkish historical society if one were to examine the sample authentic text provided in the turkish historical society study and use their same forgery test on that sample it too would be a forgery in fact if any of the tests delineated by the turkish historical society are performed an any piece of ottoman turkish or persian arabic script one finds that anything handwritten in such language is
a forgery today the body of talaat pasha lies in a tomb on liberty hill istanbul turkey just next to the yildiz university campus the body of this genocide architect was returned to turkey from germany during ww when turkey was in a heightened state of proto fascism recently this monument has served as a

to the basement they live on the first floor and have a basement which you enter across the balcony we sat in the basement while an armenian woman was beaten she ran away naked our neighbors daughter said that that s right that s what the armenians deserve because in stepanakert allegedly people were being killed girls from agdam had been raped we didn t stay very long in the basement we tried to support one another as best we could looking out the small window with the iron grating papa watched and said things now and then he said that there was a fire near building probably a
car on fire then one of the groups approached our driveway and demanded that they be shown the apartments where armenians lived the neighbors said that there weren t any armenians here and the group set out for the other wing of the building they appeared from the side of the building where i later found out a woman had been murdered the woman who ran away naked died yuri

call a crowd ran into our entryway bursting into the building they broke
down the door and came into the apartment they came straight to our apartment they knew exactly where the armenians were they came into our place we tried to resist but there was nothing we could do one of them took my parents passports and began to read them he read the surname danielian turned the page read armenian and that alone
was enough to doom us he said that we should be moved quickly out into the courtyard where they would have done with us another standing next to him pushed some of the keys on the piano and said your death has tolled they had knives and steel truncheons i had a knife in my hand unfortunately i didn t use it i just knew that if

lying next to me the crowd is gone the only people around are watching from their balconies that s it i try to pick them up but can t my left arm is broken i start toward the drive wanting to tell the neighbors to call an ambulance the bodies of my parents are still warm we were attacked at around o clock i regain consciousness at about and try to make it up the stairs home when i knock at the neighbors door they push me back and tell me to go away i go up to the third floor our neighbor puts a damp cloth on my head and says she will call an ambulance she
sends her son off for one and takes me to our apartment i often look out the window to see if the ambulance has arrived but i can t see very far as a result of the blows and it seems that my parents have already been taken away then i calm down and try to convince myself that they have been taken away and everything will be ok but they were still there later at in the morning as i found out the
ambulance picked them up but they were already dead if they received
attention on time it is possible they would still be alive later around o clock on the th policemen in civilian clothing come to our house with some assistants they call an ambulance and minutes later it arrives and i am taken to the sumgait emergency hospital there they stitch the wounds
on my head and rebind my arm at o clock i and the other armenians who are in the hospital are sent by ambulance to baku in my ward at the sumgait hospital there were five people all of them
armenians the hospital was nearly overflowing with armenians the only
azerbaijanis there were those whose car had flipped over before the events before the th then i was in the semashko hospital in baku i was there days when i was released on the th day i found out that my parents were dead at first they told me that they were in moscow being treated but later i found out that they were dead my father s older brother told me my father s name was nikolai artemovich danielian he was born in my mother born in was seda osipovna danielian papa worked at pmk the leader of the roofing brigade mamma was a compressor operator they were also beaten on the head the coroner s report stated that their
heads were smashed open and bled profusely at the confrontation i met jeykhun mamedov who had called as it turned out later he had been the one who tipped the crowd off he had called specifically to find out if we were at home and to find out the exact address and dispatch the group he knew the phone number but didn t know the address before the events i had never seen him but had often spoken with him on the phone when he would ask to speak with my father i knew him by name he denies that i was the one who answered the phone saying that my father answered it he denies that he called from a public phone saying that he called from home which also isn t true i heard noise and the sounds of automobiles as i later found out earlier he had been convicted but had never served any time he had received a suspended sentence he was about years old i don t know if he has since confessed or not i am sure that he was the one who tipped the crowd off one hundred percent sure my parents were from karabagh father was from the village of badar and was two years old when his family moved to baku where his elder brothers were to
go to school he was a student at the naval school but never graduated he
went off to work on the virgin lands one of the gigantic agricultural projects instituted under khrushchev when he returned he lived in baku and later moved to sumgait helping with the town s construction mamma was from the village of dagdagan also from karabagh she worked in sumgait first in a bookstore and later on a construction site my sister is older than i she lives with her husband here in karabagh i
always loved my parents that was why i went on to th grade because it
was their dream that i would continue my studies i finished th grade and
wanted to enter the baku nautical school and after that the military
school but later i changed my mind or rather my parents got me to recon sider saying that it would be better to finish the th grade and then join the naval school i was planning to be in the navy almost my whole life
long since childhood i had dreamed of being a sailor my father wanted it
more than anything he always recollected his youth telling of the school and he always said that he had made a big mistake in leaving it now i live in karabagh and never plan to leave here i will stay at the home of my grandfather of my ancestors till the end of my days while in the hospital in baku i learned the fates of many others who had
suffered as well like ishkhan trdatov he managed to hold them off at
their residence in microdistrict building apartment for a long
time lost his father gabriel and by some miracle managed to survive i
also learned of uncle sasha from building whose daughter was raped besides them valery i forgot his last name was in the hospital too about a year younger than i he went to school no he was riding with
his parents in the car people were throwing rocks at them he was hit and
his parents brought him to the hospital and he was in our ward we even
came to be friends before that we had just seen each other around town but
in the hospital we got to know one another better i learned of the fates of
others those who had died or who were befallen by misfortune today suren harutunian the first secretary of the communist party of armenia was shown on television to be honest i am glad that armenia agreed to recognize nagorno karabagh as part of the armenian soviet socialist republic i was repelled no revolted to hear the baku announcer who read the decision
of the azerbaijani supreme soviet presidium against karabagh becoming part of armenia after the events in sumgait and those in baku the best solution is to give
karabagh to armenia return it to armenia since the people want to live
peacefully with the azerbaijanis but everything has to be right before they
can do that i arrived in karabagh on april i felt very bad i had constant headaches after a while my strength returned my older sister suzanna took me in i think that justice should prevail the people are demanding their due you can t take away what is their due my parents and i often spoke of nagorno
karabagh often visited here spent almost all of my vacations here we had even decided that if karabagh would be made part of armenia we would move here for sure we always said that the armenian people had suffered much and that what had been done in removing nagorno karabagh from armenia was
wrong sooner or later mistakes should be corrected and in order to correct a mistake it must not be repeated and the fate of all nagorno karabagh lies in the hands of our government june stepanakert"
75412.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"contrary to what the protocols of zion crowd might suggest judaism does not have any such goals the question you ask is complicated and deserves an honest answer i am going to provide one from my own current perspective not a historical
one currently as a non observant jew israeli american my own feeling
is that jews from the diaspora do not have a greater right in palestine or
israel than the palestinians or israelis both arab and jew do with regard to jewish israelis they should have the same rights
in israel as do all other israelis who are them if by them you mean the non religious jews i think
you should be aware by now that the majority of the settlers and their
supporters are religious the other part of the problem is to my
knowledge not that the palestinians don t want to be a part of israel as much as they would accept for the most part being full citizens
of israel with all the priviliges and responsibilities accorded israeli
citizens what they object to is the current limbo in which they find
themselves"
75414.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"sorry guys for this long article but in fact it is mostly quotings well if you just waited for more lines you would have read my statement secondly surely israeli have human rights but because they belong to the human race or do you disagree on that too i donot know about you but it makes full sense to me israelis are being killed because israel is occupying let israel withdraw
and israeli blood will be saved it isnot the palestineans who undermined
the right of life of israelis but it is israel which occupied and exposed the life of its citizens to the the unconcluded war of more generally the violence in the occupied terretories is part of the intifada and i had previously posted a long article about this issue whom i finished
by an open question suppose the intifada stops what is the motive for israel to withdraw donot tell hope for peace and this bullshit everybody in the world looks
and hopes for peace so why isnot there any hope of peace is necessary
but not sufficient motive as for the arabian countries their problems are an arabian concern the arabian people can deal with it themselves if the west doesnot intervene as for serbs i donot think that those fucked up rapists excuse my language
but it really hurts as much if i was in bosnia itself arenot humans those
surely came from outer space or something no human can allow himself
to see such attrocities than to participate in ok my definition is the same as yours but one has to look into the world politics in politics a solution doesnot imply just solution it seems that it was problem in the definition of solution i think a solution must be just because otherwise it would never be lasting however when politicians say a solution they donot mean a just solution but just a solution hasan"

75417.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"the theory is that the hollering kills the spirit of the criminal nazi armenians of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle now try dealing with the rest of what i wrote what is more the activities of the armenian government seem to have been
efforts aimed at eradicating a race the turks or aimed at carrying out a
one sided feud instead of being a struggle for liberation from the outset the efforts of the armenian revolutionaries within the ottoman borders took
the form of terrorist and destructive actions aimed at mass murder cruelty
and genocide so that no other interpretation of them is possible armenian
activities started during the reign of abdulhamid ii as individual acts of
terror and then developed into assassinations and surprise attacks the element
of brute force in these activities increased steadily culminating in mass
rebellions and widespread fighting during the first world war furthermore when the ottoman army withdrew from eastern anatolia after the sarikamis
defeat armenian revolutionaries initiated a series of cruelties in this area although the russians occupied eastern anatolia as an enemy nevertheless they
were constrained by the rules of war however when they returned to their
country in after the revolution armenian revolutionaries were unchecked
in this area for about a year until the ottoman forces returned to erzurum
in during this period armenian revolutionaries executed massacres on
the local people which is recorded in historical documents for example let us look at a report dated march which the commander
of the third army submitted when he entered erzurum and erzincan they were completely and systematically destroyed and burned down by armenians even the trees were cut down and they are like a building entirely consumed by fire in every sense of the word as for the people who had been living in erzurum and erzincan those who were capable of fighting were taken away at the very beginning with the excuse of forced labor in road construction they were taken in the direction of sarikamis and annihilated when the russian army withdrew a part of the remaining people was destroyed in armenian massacres and cruelties they were thrown into wells they were locked in houses and burned down they were killed with bayonets and swords in places selected as butchering spots their bellies were torn open their lungs were pulled out and girls and women were hanged by their hair after being subjected to every conceivable abominable act a very small part of the people who were spared these abominations far worse than the cruelty of the inquisition resembled living dead and were suffering from temporary insanity because of the dire poverty they had lived in and because of the frightful experiences they had been subjected to including women and children such persons discovered so far do not exceed one thousand five hundred in erzincan and thirty thousand in erzurum all the fields in erzincan and erzurum are untilled everything that the people had has been taken away from them and we found them in a destitute situation at the present time the people are subsisting on some food they obtained impelled by starvation from russian storages left behind after their occupation of this area foreign observers who witnessed the events including russian officers
who did not desert their lines submitted detailed reports proving the
genocide to ottoman commanders who received them as prisoners of war what is most important is that they stated in their reports the massacres did not happen by chance but were planned at the end of the war the german author dr weiss his austrian colleague
dr stein and his turkish colleague mr ahmet vefik visited trabzon kars erzurum and batum between april th and may th to record the
cruelties their writings not only show the scope of armenian activities but also reveal their goal and true nature the ottoman state the ministry of war islam ahalinin ducar olduklari mezalim hakkinda vesaike mustenid malumat istanbul the french la population musulmane istanbul in the latin script h k turkozu ed osmanli ve sovyet belgeleriyle ermeni mezalimi ankara in addition z basar ed ermenilerden gorduklerimiz ankara and edited by the same author ermeniler hakkinda makaleler derlemeler ankara askeri tarih belgeleri vol december document numbered askeri tarih belgeleri vol december document numbered from twerdo khlebof s report dated april quoted in ermeniler vol p a r altinay iki komite iki kital istanbul and kafkas yollarinda hatiralar ve tahassusler istanbul serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded in the work of extermination ohanus appressian in soviet armenia today there no longer exists a single turkish soul sahak melkonian"

75876.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"it is very encouraging that a number of people took so interest in my posting i recieved a couple of letters too some has debated the statement that events in bosnia are unprecedented in the history of the modern world those who contest this statement present the figures of the world war ii however we must keep in mind that it was a world war and no country had the power to stop it today is the matter not of the power but of the will it
seems to be that what we lack is the will second point of difference which makes it different from the holocast sp is that at that time international community
didnot have enough muscle to prevent the unfortunate event today inspite of all the might the international community is not just standing neutral but has placed an arms embargo which
is to the obvious disadvantage of the weeker side and therefore to the advantage of the bully hence indirecltly and possibly
unintentionally mankind has sided with the killers and this i think is unprecedented in the history of the modern world m rizvi"

blame one side only there always are bad guys on both sides what were you doing on anatolia after the ww anyway do you think it was your right to be there i am not saying that conflicts started with that it is only
not one side being the aggressive and the ither always suffering it is sad that we both still are not trying to compromise i remember the action of the turkish government by removing the
visa requirement for greeks to come to turkey i thought it
was a positive attempt to make the relations better the greeks i mentioned who wouldn t talk to me are educated
people they have never met me but they know i am bad person
because i am from turkey politics is not my business and it is
not the business of most of the turks when it comes to individuals why the hatred so that makes me think that there is some kind of

secretary of the smu komsomol organization resident at building b apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan on the th my sister marina and i went to the movies the seven o clock show at the theater that is across from the city party committee about yards away the sk theater they were showing an argentinian film the abyss before the film we noticed about to people standing near the podium at the city party committee but they were silent there s no conversation whatsoever and we couldn t figure out what was going on that is we knew it was about karabagh but what it was exactly what they were talking about if someone gave a speech or not we didn t know we bought our tickets there were or people in the theater this was a very small number for that large movie theater the film started about minutes later they stopped the
film a crowd burst in about people they came up onto the stage well mostly they were young people from to years old they demanded that an armenian woman come up onto the stage they used foul language and said that they were going to show what azerbaijanis were capable of what they could do to armenian girls i thought that s what they meant because they had demanded a girl specifically marina and i were sitting together i told her to move over there were some russian girls sitting nearby so that if someone recognized me or if something happened they would take me and not marina it got quiet or girls jumped up to run out but the door was closed it s
only opened at the end of the show and they returned to their seats everyone in the theater was looking at one another russians azerbaijanis people of various nationalities but no one reacted at all no one in the auditorium made a sound they were silent looking at one another and gradually started to leave some guy a really fat one says ok we ve scared them enough let s leave they leave slowly pompously it seemed to me that those people were not themselves either they had smoked a bunch of anasha or had taken something else because they all looked beastly like they were ready to tear anyone apart then it was all over as though nothing had happened at all the film started up again it was one of those cheerful films which should have only brought pleasure made you happy to be alive we could barely sit to the end so it had started at seven it was over by nine and it was dark marina and i were walking home lenin street that s the center of town lenin
street was packed just packed with young people they were shouting something about karabagh and something about armenians we weren t especially listening because the way we were feeling we didn t know if we were going to make it home or not and just what had happened anyway public transportation wasn t running incidentally when we came out of the theater we saw police policemen standing there the director of the movie theater was looking at the
doors because when they were leaving they had broken the glass the doors there are basically all glass everything was broken he stood there grief stricken but looking as though nothing really big had happened like some naughty boys had just broken them quite by accident with a slingshot well since he looked more or less calm i decided that nothing all that super serious had happened we went out very slowly we wanted to catch a bus we live literally one stop away we didn t want to go on foot not because it was
dark but because something might happen we flagged down a cab but the driver didn t want to take us we told him we live near the bus station and he said he d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther i said well ok so we got into the cab and managed to get there something incredible was happening at the bus station there was a traffic jam public transportation was at a standstill and everyone was shouting ka ra bagh they re not going to give up karabagh i go home and tell my family what s going on and there s
immediate panic in the house mamma says what should we do like the end had come they were going to come kill us that s it somehow we managed to cheer ourselves up nothing that bad could happen where are we living anyway just what kind of social order do we have somehow we manage to calm mamma down and we went to bed but no one could sleep everyone made as though nothing had happened that was on saturday in short the day went by we didn t go anywhere and didn t call our relatives no one did anything because life goes on that day i realized something was approaching but what exactly i couldn t
guess on the th everything was like it was supposed to be we lived like we always
had there were five of us at home mamma papa and us three sisters lyuda marina and i my sister lyuda was in yerevan at the time we sat at home and no one went out later we learned that a demonstration had started that morning it all started they were smashing up stores we were sitting at
home and didn t know anything about it then a girlfriend of mine lyuda zimogliad came by at around three o clock i think we worked together we did
our apprenticeships together she s a russian girl she said that something
awful was happening in town i asked don t they want armenians well what are they after if they re already in that state she says no nothing like that it s just a demonstration but it s awful to watch it somehow it feels
like a war has broken out public transportation has been stopped the cabs the buses well it s just a nightmare then papa decides to go to the drugstore my mother was having allergy problems at the time he left the house and our neighbor aunt vera asked him where are you going stop there are such terrible things going
on in the courtyard aren t you afraid to go out papa didn t know what she
was talking about she simply pushed him back into the entryway he came home and told mamma mamma said well if aunt vera was talking like that it means
that something is really going on but we didn t go see her she s a russian she lives across from us i had to see my friend out around five o clock i tell lyuda ok look it s time for you to go it s late already i ll see you out mamma says you don t need to go it s too late already you can see what the situation in town is so we decided to stay home dinner was ready mamma says let her eat with us then she can go we sat down at the table but no one was hungry no one was in the mood we just put everything out on the table to calm ourselves down and make it appear that we re eating we turned on the television and the show in fairy tale land was coming on we cleared the table we hear some noise out in the courtyard i go out on the balcony but i can t see what s going on because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus
station and there is a story building in the way there is mob of people i can t figure out what s happening they re shouting something looking
somewhere i can t make out what is going on i go down to a neighbor she s an azerbaijani we ve been friends of her family for about years i go down
to look from their place i see people shouting looking at the and story buildings near the bus station just then soldiers set upon them about people with clubs the mob runs off in different directions i even see several people from our building they are looking and laughing i decide
that means it s not all that bad if they are laughing it means they re not killing anyone but now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers one of the soldiers cannot manage to get away they start stomping on him with their feet everyone s kicking him i become ill and go home and explain in general terms that horrible things are going on out there can t speak well they ve probably killed that soldier the way that crowd is if each of them kicked him just once they took his club away from him
and started to beat him with it but it was far away and i couldn t see if he
got up and left or not i become terrified and go home and say lyuda don t go anywhere stay at our
place because if you go out they could kill you or then the crowd runs over closer toward our building and stands at the story building and starts shouting something we go out onto the balcony all of our neighbors are also out on theirs too everyone is standing staring the mob is shouting and about minutes later comes running toward our building as it turns out at the story building the azerbaijani neighbors went down and kept them from coming in there s only one entryway there they could stop them they all run up to our building mamma immediately starts closing the windows afraid that they might throw stones they have stones and they break the windows all of them there are very many people we have a large courtyard and it s packed with people they spill up to the first floor so they don t crush each other they crawl up on trees posts and garages it s just a huge
cloud of people they break and burn the motorcycle of the armenian sergey sargisian from our building we close the windows and immediately hear tramping in our entryway they come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous din and roar it s incomprehensible mamma told me later that they were shouting father s name grisha open the door we ve come to kill you or
something like that i don t remember that i was spaced out kind of mamma says into the bedroom quickly in the bedroom we have two tall beds part of our dowry mamma says hide there they probably won t come in there they ll ask something say something and leave she says we ll tell them that we live alone here i can t imagine that my parents will stand out in the hall alone talking with some sort of beasts i go to them and say that i ll stand together with them i ll talk with them if they come maybe i can find a common language with them all the more so if they know me i speak azerbaijani more or less and i can find out what they want i told marina and
lyuda to hide under the bed and my sister lyuda i can t remember if i told her anything or not then they open the door it s like they blew on it and it broke and fell
right into the hall the crows bursts in and starts to shout get out of here leave vacate the apartment and go back to your armenia things like that i
tell them what has happened speak calmly one of you tell me calmly what
has happened in azerbaijani they say get out of the apartment leave i say ok go downstairs we ll gather everything we need and leave the apartment i realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with
them these are animals they must be stopped the ones standing in the
doorway the young guys say there are old people and one girl with them too bad they take two or three steps back it seems as though i have
pacified them with our exchange then someone in the courtyard shouts commanding them don t you understand what you are saying kill them and that was it that was all it took they grab papa carry him into one
room and mamma and me into another they put mamma on the bed and start undressing her beating her legs they start tearing my clothes right there in front of mamma i don t remember where they went what they did or how much time passed i had the feeling that they beat me on the head on my body and tore my clothes all at the same time i don t even know what i said the atrocities started i was savagely raped in that room they argued among themselves who would go first later i remember i came to i don t know if i m dead or alive someone comes
in someone tall i think clean shaven in an eskimo dogskin coat balding he looks around at what s happening at that instant everything stops it seems to me that he is either their commander or that somehow everything
depends on him he looks and says well we re done here they are beating
mamma on the head they break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs she loses consciousness and they decide that she s dead papa was
out cold they want to throw lyuda off the balcony but they can t get the window open apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the windows can t be opened they leave her next to the window she was thinking about being thrown out the window and passed out she s not a real strong person anyway he looks at me and sees that i m saying something that
i m still twitching well i start saying the opposite of what i should be which is humbling myself and pleading i start shouting cursing they don t get any entreaty out of me i already know that i m dead why would i humble myself before anyone and he says that if that s what i think since my
tongue is so long maybe he thinks that i still look quite appealing in short he commands that i be taken outside i no longer saw or remembered what was happening to marina and lyuda i don t know if they are alive or not they take me outside they are dragging me by my arms by my legs they are hitting me against the wall the railings something metal while they are carrying me someone is biting me someone
else is pinching me i don t even know i think my god when will death come if only it were sooner then they carry me out throw me near
the entryway and start kicking me i lose consciousness what happened after that how many people there were i don t remember i come to after a while i don t remember how long a neighbor is bringing me clothing i m entirely covered with blood she puts a dress on me i remember that i said the same words over and over again mamma what happened mamma what have they done to us where are we whose house are we at i can t make sense out of anything there is a guy standing over me i sort of know him he
served in afghanistan his name is igor he brought me indoors when they all went to the third entryway and killed a person there igor gathered his courage took me into his arms and brought me to the neighbors even though he s small minded he put himself at risk igor agayev is azerbaijani he served in afghanistan there are three brothers the older brother also served
there i think now he s stationed here on the border in armenia igor brought me to the neighbors and then helped me come to my senses saying karina i know you calm down i m not one of them how do i know who s who and what s what i come to and they clean me up i was covered in blood then
papa i saw papa i saw mamma and marina too igor was there when they dragged marina and lyuda out from under the bed marina lyuda said that she was russian they said we ll let you go we aren t touching the
russians go and while they are dragging marina out she decides she s going to tell them she s azerbaijani igor immediately grabs marina s and lyuda s hands because he knows marina and knows that she is armenian and is our sister and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor s and starts pounding on the door so she will open up she opens the door and igor pushes them in there so they survived my sister lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things while they were going downstairs taking things downstairs then coming back up again lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed there then when she was herself again she found a torn night shirt and put it on and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor s on the fourth floor the
one whose apartment i had watched the crowd from the friend of ours and knocked on the door the neighbor opened and said i m not going to let you in the apartment because i m afraid of them but i ll give you some stockings and we ll leave the building lyuda says i ll stay at your place because of
what s going on they keep going up and down the stairs it was just for a moment just a moment in life but the neighbor wouldn t consent lyuda came back to our place and lay under the bed i came to mother was there i can t remember my supervisor s telephone number but something had to be done somehow i remembered and called and he came to get us he didn t have any idea what was going on he thought we were simply afraid he didn t know that they were killing us and that we had passed
between life and death he came and got us and took us to the police precinct there they looked us over i was having trouble walking my lungs hurt badly it was hard to breathe my supervisor s name is urshan feyruzovich mamedov he s the head of our administration they took us there when we were leaving i saw a great number
of buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town the buses were ordinary passenger buses there were very many soldiers we left around eleven right after eleven if these people could stop what was happening they could save a great many lives because the crowd was moving on toward the school and
what was going on there i think everyone know not only in sumgait not only in yerevan because there they murdered them all one after the next without stopping after us i think people died in microdistrict no and to of them were from
buildings and in our building one person died and one old woman died
from building that s the building in front of ours there young azerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn t let it into their building incidentally when we were at the neighbors marina called our relatives
to warn them so they would all know what was happening i called a aunt in microdistrict no they have three neighbors who are armenians i said run
quickly i can t explain what s going on hide do what you can just stay
alive hide at azerbaijanis ones who won t give you away at that moment three people came in policemen i think they were azerbaijanis i was in such
awful condition my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up there was blood my eye was swollen no one thought i would ever see anything out of that eye again my forehead was badly cut and one half of my face
was pushed out forward no one would have thought that i would survive get my
normal appearance back and be able to grasp anything at all i started to scream at those people why did you come who sent you here no one wants you here haven t you killed people people yet what are you doing here one of the soldiers said don t scream at us we re muslims but we re not from the sumgait police they called in from daghestan so at that point the daghestan police were there when we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there there were soldiers police with dogs ambulances firemen i don t know maybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously injured to treat them there in the police precinct i don t know what they were there for there were also doctors from baku there they examined lyuda and me and said these women need to go to the maternity home but we don t know what to do with the rest so they took us and i lost contact with my parents my boss everyone my boss said don t worry i ll find you no matter where you are no matter
what happens we went to the hospital there we were examined by a department
head from the sumgait maternity home pashayeva i think her name was she examined us the ambulance was from baku i figured out that the sumgait ambulances hadn t done anything they didn t respond to any calls people called and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life that doctor looked me over and i could tell from her behavior that something
very good had happened for she became quite glad i even thought to myself god can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong she looks me over and says now why are you suffering so you don t know what your people have been
doing your people did even worse things and i think great i have to deal with her and i felt so bad i thought why don t i just die so as not to
have to hear more stuff like this from people like her here i am in this condition and being told about something that our people did i just didn t have the energy to say how could our people possibly be smart enough to think of something that yours haven t already done i stayed there then they
brought in another woman ira b she was married and she was raped in her own apartment too there were three of us ira lyuda and the next morning they took lyuda and ira away they didn t do anything to help us this
was in the old maternity home in the combined block they didn t do anything more than examine me that was it i didn t want any shots or tranquilizer nothing what shots could have calmed me down i didn t even want to look at them i lay in the ward either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur pose but i was alone i was alone even though the wards were packed that
same evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me that my face
was disfigured she asked what had happened to me and i said better to ask your brother what happened there s no point in asking me your brother can better explain what happened she fell into a faint all the doctors threw themselves at her and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my
ward then people from work came to see me my boss his daughter they brought me clothing because i was literally naked the only thing i had on was a dress but the woman who gave it to me was very short and the dress was way up above my knees and the woman orderly said i can t believe you put on such a
short dress who are you showing off your legs to here i went back to my ward thinking just one more thing from something people from work came and brought me something in a sack apples i think three or four pounds but i couldn t take them i had become so weak that it was just embarrassing i said
that i couldn t take the apples and really didn t have any appetite no one had to bring me anything some woman took the sack and oh yes then i heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should be hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that i was an armenian maybe they wouldn t figure it out from looking at me so they must have been thinking that there would be some kind of attack that something else would happen that it would be worse or perhaps someone was outside on
the street i don t know in any case i didn t sleep a wink that night the next morning they picked me up a whole police detail put me in a bus and off we went i didn t even know where they were taking me they took me to
the club where the troops were the very one i was in that ill fated evening i got off the bus near the city party committee there were a great many troops tanks armored personnel carriers the whole scene was terrible i saw a few people i knew there and that calmed me a little i had already thought that i was the only one left so there were five or six of us left in sumgait after that night i still didn t know what happened to my parents they didn t come to see me in the hospital and my boss told me that everything was fine i didn t know whether to believe him or not maybe he was just trying to calm me down maybe something happened on the way then i went to the club and saw a lot of people i knew they all knew one another they were all kissing each other and asking what happened what went on two days later they came to see me from work they were there all the time each day they came showed interest and were constantly bringing me money they did everything they could of course i m most thankful to my boss the only one of my colleagues who didn t lose his presence of mind and who didn t change his opinions neither before nor after nor in the heat of the moment no matter what happened he constantly took an interest a sincere interest from the heart then about two days later the secretary of the party committee came not from our party organization but from the first trust which ours is part of comrade kerimov a very important figure in our town he made arrangements
with the emergency medical personnel to take me away because if i sat down by
myself i couldn t get up or lie down again there was something wrong with my
lungs it was hard to breathe they examined me there several times there i lay were several doctors they all thought that that it must just be from all the blows i don t know they didn t diagnose anything in particular when i was in the maternity home i even asked i made it a point of insisting that they take me to the trauma section because i felt so awful there was no way something inside wasn t broken my ribs well they took me there and took x rays and said that everything was fine there were emergency medical workers on duty in the club the mother of one of marina s friends was there she was the head doctor at the sumgait children s clinic they had every kind of antifever agent in the world which was exactly what i
needed at that moment i thought i said that i was having great difficulty
breathing i couldn t seem to get enough air something was wrong with me they put tight bandages around my chest and waist later i overheard some
people saying that i had been cut all over i think they just saw me being all
bandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut but i
wasn t cut they took us to the khimik boarding house we lived there a long time soon appeared representatives they were agitating at first people would not talk to them and drove them off one of the armenian women shouted we demand that seidov come the response was it s seidov who sent us seidov is the chairman of the azerbaijani council of ministers the woman said we ll only see seidov s daughter have her come here we ll do the same things to her that they did to our daughters and then we ll deal with you agitators and so on more of them said have seidov himself come this went on day in day out the agitators kept coming and coming this drove us out of our wits then people gradually started departing for yerevan because they realized it was senseless to stay everything got on our nerves the smell the small children there were children at the sk club children who had literally just come out of the maternity home what were they doing in a club that didn t even have running water all the time at first we had to pay to eat there they even overcharged us as it turned out on the second day someone told us that they would bring us food for free the children were ill everything stank there well imagine about people in a small movie theater with seating for no more than you couldn t sit or lie down it was impossible to even move the stench was awful even the smallest infants took ill overnight there i heard that they were arriving seriously ill in yerevan the infants they have to be washed they have to be bathed not to mention that we the adults were ill and needed care people were fainting right and left i just don t know everyone was crying everyone only the young people the men somehow managed to keep it together but the women were in a constant state of panic it seemed to everyone that they would come any minute and kill and stab it seemed clear that we had been gathered together purposely like during the war so that they could burn the movie theater and there wouldn t be a single armenian left then people went up to the attic i didn t see them i only heard them because i was lying down and couldn t get up i lay right on the stage we had some room there apparently they caught two people with either oil or gas i think they wanted to burn the
theater maybe someone saw them i didn t i was in no condition to open my eyes everyone was suspicious of everyone else they would ask aren t you an azerbaijani i think i saw you somewhere i think you re an azerbaijani they
led out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their
passports relatives might be covering for each other half of the people did
not have any documents there were people who had run out of their homes in nothing but a pair of pants and slippers or wearing just a shirt not like
they should have with their ids so on the th on sunday i think the police did nothing to help us on
monday everything resumed where it had left off on block a they didn t spare a soul there not children not pregnant women nobody they killed they burned they hacked with axes just everything possible they murdered the melkumian family whom i knew my mother worked with them their daughter in law went to school with my older sister they were brutally murdered only the two daughters in law survived by a miracle one was able to save herself she ran away the neighbors wouldn t take her in so she ran about the building until she found refuge she was pregnant and had two small children this all continued on monday in block a on the th when the troops were already in the city they murdered people they overturned automobiles and they burned entire families they say they didn t even know for sure if the people were armenians
or not i heard that the lezgins suffered too i m not sure myself i didn t see any lezgins who had been injured they burned cars so it s very difficult now to say exactly who died and who didn t it was very difficult to identify the corpses or rather what remained of the corpses after they were doused in
gasoline and burned it s all very hard to imagine of course i heard that many people disappeared without a trace from the btz plant two people including a woman who worked the night shift aunt razmella who also lived in
microdistrict they were stopping buses between baku and sumgait in the evening people who had been visiting baku were returning to sumgait and people from baku were going home from sumgait and there were students too they were simply savagely murdered they were stopping the buses the drivers immediately did what they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that hoard of brutally minded people they stopped the buses dragged the armenians
out and killed them on the spot i didn t see it myself but i heard that they
put them all in a pile so as to burn them later it was hard to discern from the corpses well you can t call them corpses you had to figure out from the ashes who it was l heard that two fellows saved two women one a student ira
g if i m not mistaken she was in the hospital a long time after that and she still can t figure out who saved her she was also brutally raped and beaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses the fellow pulled her out of that whole pile of corpses put his coat on her took her into his arms and carried her to the city i still can t imagine how he managed to do that i heard that from engels grigorian he knows her apparently well a lot of people went to that hospital anyway she was in the hospital and singing a song in armenian and they wrote the words down and i think he still has that piece of paper because he says that a lot of people now have that song the one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape they couldn t find the guy who saved her he left her in someone s apartment and
called the ambulance she was in such awful shape that probably like me she couldn t remember anyone s face i think that i knew one of the people who broke into our house maybe i had talked with him once but i received so many blows everything was just knocked
out of my head i can t remember to this day who he was then it seems i saw
the secretary of the directorate s party organization where marina works she
goes to school and works she goes to night school at azi and works by day at
the khimzashchita construction and installation administration i m the secretary of the komsomol organization at our administration and often met with the secretaries of party and komsomol organizations we had joint meetings i know them all i ve even talked with them and he i know is from
armenia an azerbaijani but from armenia it became obvious that many of those people were azerbaijanis born in armenia they took me to various police stations to the police precinct and to the
procuracy because the ussr procuracy got involved in the case and i iden tified the photographs of people who i could more or less recognize they
showed me the people who were in our apartment they re working on our
case but i can t even recognize them although it was proved that they were
the ones they re processing it somehow they tell me that they know that
someone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were dragging me there was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch me he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that all these people all of them as much as i ve heard about them and seen them they were
all from kafan the secretary of the party organization is named najaf najaf rzayev he was there when everything started it must have been him because i didn t recognize anyone else in the crowd whom i knew besides him all the more since
i told him listen you do something because you know me he turned away and went toward the bedroom where marina was well you couldn t see marina anyway there was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn t make out anyone all of it flew right out of my head and then gradually i became myself again at the city party committee there were military people there i told them what went on and they wrote it all down i told them his name on march the secretary of our first trust party organization the one we re part of came to see us his name is najaf rzayev i tell mamma if
he s here despite the fact that i gave his name it means that either his alibi has been confirmed or probably that they think i m crazy not responsible for my words he said what did they do to you how awful myself i hid an armenian family then after some time goes by he comes back again and says something entirely different i wasn t at home my family and i went to baku i said marina what is he saying he said something totally
different before after that i didn t go to see our procurator our case is being handled by a procurator from voronezh fedorov by name fedorov told me that rzayev s case had just gotten to him and there were so names involved what are they doing with rzayev did he prove his alibi or not they just think that since i was hit in the head i can t say anything for sure whether it was him or not it will be an insult if he was in our apartment and doesn t have to pay for it but at the same time i m afraid to say i m a hundred percent sure that it was he because no mat ter who i name they tell me no you re wrong he didn t do that that one
wasn t there all the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind who did what
exactly i can t say when they took me outside there was a whole crowd there but i didn t see it because i had my eyes closed all the time it seemed to me that i always got
it because of my eyes people were always hassling me for some reason it always seemed to me that my eyes are responsible when they were beating my face i thought they were trying to put my eyes out so i had my eyes closed they took me outside and started to beat me a young guy held my arms he
works at the btz plant and right nearby across the road from us block is where all this was going on right across the road from us the btz dormitory is over there that s where he lives now he s in custody they even
have proved as far as i know that it was he who killed shurik gambarian the
clarinet player from the third entryway of our building one person in our building was killed it was that man a guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me he saw that
he was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me but he didn t come over he just looked and then went into the dormitory a while after it was all over people started making announcements in town saying that investigators had been summoned that guy went and told them everything now they ve caught him everything s been proved now evidently they ve been
beating him i don t know what they re doing with them over there but he himself said that he was working the night shift at the plant some young guy came to the plant and said everyone who wants to kill armenians come to the bus station on saturday at ten that was it he said the ones who wanted to went this was at the btz plant during the night shift probably late friday
night it was at night they were at the sauna together and he said what do you mean do you understand what you are saying the others were silent probably in their hearts they were thinking i m going to go but they didn t
say anything to one another he said that he thought it important to to go because he had heard a lot about what had happened in kafan that they had killed their azerbaijani sisters their mothers burned villages and all of that that guy was also born in kafan that is certain and marina says that the secretary of the party organization is from armenia too from i ve participated in the investigation a couple of times i m satisfied with
them thus far they summoned us and asked about what happened and every word i said was recorded i met some guy there by the way he was an armenian i said that he was in our apartment but what he did i don t know his last name was grigorian eduard grigorian he s from sumgait from microdistrict he was sentenced i think to five years not his first time his mother is russian i met with him at the kgb in baku at the azerbaijani kgb they took us there and showed me photographs there were so many photographs i think they even photographed those people who were caught at curfew and i ve got them all confused i say the face was about like this the guy in the white coat with the red clasps but he could take that coat off
and burn it somewhere and it would be like looking for a needle in a haystack well this guy grigorian i said he was in our apartment but he is so light complected that he looks like a lezgin i don t know what he did i can t remember maybe he beat me or raped me but he was in our apartment at the kgb he started asking me pleading with me there s no need for this all this stuff look me in the eyes you re like a sister to me i took a look
at him and thought my god heaven forbid that i should have a brother like you but they were satisfied with my responses because i said everything without great certainty i was there with mamma then lyuda came in but when she came in she got sick immediately she wanted to kill him she crawled over
the table at him she recognized him when she came to lyuda was lying on the
balcony the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom we had all kinds of boxes with dishes in them the dowries for all three sisters they stole everything in the apartment leaving only small things at that moment lyuda came to and started remembering everything well seeing the faces hearing the voices two people were saying they could burn the apartment another says why burn the apartment when i ve got three kids and no place to live so this guy was in temporary housing he didn t have anywhere to live he was from sumgait they were sure that they would get the apartment besides the neighbors were azerbaijani why should they burn the apartment they might burn azerbaijanis that s what they said how did they know there were azerbaijanis there if they just picked a place thinking that
armenians lived there we have a list of the residents for our part of the building our name is in there but how could they know that azerbaijanis lived on the other side of the wall from us so they didn t set fire to our apartment i don t know i was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt when i was outside if someone had asked me what was happening i would
have said that a civil war was going on well maybe not civil but
probably civil because when they were beating me i opened my eyes and saw
that all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching like at
a free horror film so a civil war was going on and only the armenians were
being fought if it were a world war or something like that they would have
been fighting everyone but they only fought us then i met some women from our building some azerbaijanis they are crying they tell me karina we saw all of it how could it happen they re asking me well i just don t know
what to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to me i think that if it were the other way around either i wouldn t have been able to take it or i would have tried to avert it like that one azerbaijani woman did in front of our building a woman lives there an awful dissipated woman if you can call her a woman the dissipated life she leads two armenian families live there in her part of the building she came out on the
balcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse she came down to the entryway and said you ll come in this entryway over my dead
body so not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway some folks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn t even know what they were doing i don t think that s true they knew very well
what they were doing if they didn t even lift a hand against that woman they couldn t have cared less about her but the fact that she was an azerbaijani stopped them they were just beasts they had smoked so much when they came to our place they were all chewing something i noticed everyone who came into the apartment was chewing something i think my god maybe i just think that maybe i m losing my mind but no they re all chewing something maybe it is some kind of drug it must be because at first glance they all seemed to be such normal people young clean shaven looking exactly as if they had come to some sort of celebration but they were shouting something they
didn t talk they shouted as though there were deaf people there they screamed and screamed yeah killing killing we re killing the armenians only they didn t shout kill they shouted gurun ermianlary gurun literally means kill or destroy that s how it was i ll continue we hid in a captain s apartment he s an
azerbaijani his wife is a tatar we were sitting in their apartment their kids were out in the yard their kids knew a whole lot this was in our part of the building on the third floor when mamma came to and couldn t find
lyuda she took papa s hand this was while the looters were stealing things but they didn t pay attention because they were stealing things apparently
they had already ceased killing and switched to stealing mamma found the
courage to a boy said to my mother where s the gold mamma said he must have been to years old he even looked russian he was so fair skinned but the azerbaijanis from armenia are fair skinned i noticed they were all on the fair side he shouted they were all smashing things and he asks mamma where the gold is we kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers in a little black bag we kept everything in there mamma doesn t really like to wear gold she probably never even wore those things from the time they were bought for her they took everything that was lying on the cheval glass mamma
thinks that the gold saved us because they threw themselves at the gold and mamma grabbed papa who was trying to breathe they had closed his mouth bound his hands and put a pillow and a chair on his face they had shoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate mamma grabbed him and tore all that stuff off he had something in his mouth he was having trouble breathing his nose was filled with blood mamma grabbed him and started running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted to open their doors to them mamma said that by accident completely by accident that person opened his door he was sleeping and said half awake what s happened he sees that they are bloody mamma said at least go and find out what s happening to my daughters even if they ve burned them or murdered them at least bring the corpses he went looking for us at that moment lyuda was under the bed she says that after they left it seemed that someone was calling her name when he quietly called her she couldn t get out from under the bed she wanted to get out and was calling softly she thought she was shouting but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to herself it just seemed to her that she was shouting when she got out from under the bed everyone was gone and again she thought that she had lost
her mind i ll never leave here never to hell with it it just seems that way to me i ll come to eventually but then when everything had settled down stopped that mall brought lyuda down and igor carried me in from
outside or first i was brought in then lyuda i don t remember what order it
happened in and mamma said listen they re all running around down there shouting something or other and running toward the other building it had more or less calmed down where we were who s dead who s alive we don t know i tried to call my girlfriend i had basically come to mamma says listen let s go upstairs at least get a mattress or something we don t know how long we ll be here maybe they didn t burn everything i don t get it all
women have that feeling they want to get something from their homes maybe not everything was taken i tell mamma mamma what do you need any of that for to hell with it we re alive forget the rest of it all of it she
says no let s go get at least something maybe we ll leave here spend the night at someone else s mamma went upstairs and their little boy their son
alik was standing on the lookout lie was standing there to see if they were coming they only managed to run up there and grab something one time he shouts come back they re coming they didn t have enough time to get a lot mattresses from one apartment a blanket from another mamma got my knitting someone managed to grab our old things the ones we never wore out of the hall someone took father s old coveralls the neighbor his wife mamma and papa marina went with them i was in no condition to leave neither was lyuda we just sat they ran out and we closed the door and
just then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs they re dragging something again they were going toward the other building maybe over by the school or there was an unfinished building over
there people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished building they could gradually carry everything over there then things more or less calmed down i tried to call my boss later there was more noise we were on the third floor in a one bedroom
apartment and a woman lives in the one bedroom place on the second floor asya dallakian she s an old woman retired she wasn t at home at that
time she was usually in the country she has a married daughter there and
her grandson is in the army she is only very rarely in town she gets her
retirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant they started
pounding on her door and broke it down she had two or three beds in there something like that she s a to year old woman who really does not even live there probably she had some pots a couple of metal bed frames and mattresses and a television when her grandson came she bought a television they started wrecking everything i started getting sick again i think my god what is going on around here when will this end we turned off the lights and sat as it turns out the people who weren t afraid the ones who knew what was going on knew not to turn off the lights we didn t know but they didn t come to where we were all the same they all knew very well that he was a captain he went out and closed the door and we sat in his apartment his last name was kasumov he s an exserviceman retired works up at the fire station at some plant or other he went out and stood at his door they tell him comrade captain don t worry we won t harm you you re one of
us he went upstairs and they say aren t you taking anything from this apartment he says i don t need anything and the women who were standing in the yard we have a basement full of water the women who were standing in the yard saw those guys they left everything they stole on the first floor and ran upstairs again the women threw everything they had time to into the basement to save our property some things were left dirty pillows two or three other things and a rug a guy came downstairs really mad and he says where s the rug i just put it right here they tell him some guy came and took it and went off toward the school he ran off in that
direction oh i forgot the most important point when igor picked me up in his arms there were women standing there who saw everything that was going on they just didn t tell me about it for a long time the wife of that military man she didn t want to kill my spirit i was already dead enough later she told me that after they murdered uncle shurik in the third entryway one of them the ringleader apparently a young man said where s the girl who was here and he became furious the woman tells him she came to she didn t
know what to say think something up someone carried her off then they would
comb the whole house and find me and our whole family so the woman says she
came to and went to the basement now our basement is full of water so the whole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse they took flashlights they were up to their waists in water water which had been standing there for years and soot and fuel oil they climbed down in there to get me then one of them said there s so much water down there she probably walked and walked and then passed out and died she met her death in the basement that s it we can leave no problem i didn t know that and when i was told i felt worse two times worse a lot worse so they didn t just want to pound me flat something more awful was awaiting me after that we of course didn t want to live in sumgait any longer we really didn t want to go back to our apartment when we moved i went up there and started to quiver and shake all over because i started remembering it all although the neighbors all sobbed it was all so cheap the people who sat in their apartments and didn t help us at a time like that i think that they could have helped i don t think that they were obligated to but they could have helped us because that one woman was able to stop that whole brutal crowd by herself that means they could have too it would have been
enough foe one man or women to say what do you think you re doing that s all that would have done it there were apartments in our building not one person said it when i was lying on the ground and all those people were standing on their balconies i didn t hear anyone s voice no one said what are
you doing leave her alone mamma even told one of the neighbor women that if it had been an azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a
bomb if it would have killed even one armenian they would have stood up for one of their own true they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway an old sick woman tried to stop the pogrom the azerbaijanis have a custom if a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground the men are supposed to stop immediately the old woman from the fourth entryway did that but they
stomped her scarf into the ground pushed her off to the side and said if
you want to go on living you ll disappear into your apartment so she left that trick didn t work on them even the neighbors who helped us move told me ok fine calm down forget that it happened i said i d only forget it if i told them right then that it
had happened to their daughter and if that didn t have any effect on them then i would forget everything too imagine that it happened to your sister and no one did anything anything april yerevan reference the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan volume i eyewitness accounts edited by samuel shahmuradian forward by yelena bonner published by aristide d caratzas ny pages"

the class action lawsuit filed in san francisco superior court none of us has been guilty of racism or nazism or anti semitism or hate
crimes or any of the other isms that the adl claims to protect against none
of us is violent or criminal in any way said carol el shaieb an education
consultant who develops programs on arab culture the plaintiffs include yigal arens son of former israel defense minister
moshe arens the younger arens a research scientist at the university of
southern california said the adl kept a file on him in the s presumably
because he has criticized israel s treatment of palestinians the adl believes that anyone who is an arab american or speaks
politically against israel is at least a closet anti semite arens said the adl has denied any wrongdoing but couldn t comment on the lawsuit
because it hasn t reviewed it said a spokesman at the adl s new york
headquarters the fbi and local police and prosecutors are investigating allegations that
the adl spied on thousands of individuals and hundreds of groups including

charging the anti defamation league of b nai brith with violating their privacy
by spying on them for the israeli and south african governments the class action suit filed in san francisco superior court charges the adl
and its leadership conspired with a local police official to obtain information
on outspoken opponents of israeli policies towards the occupied territories and
south africa s apartheid policy the adl refused to comment on the suit the suit also took aim at two top local adl officials and retired san
francicso police officer tom gerard claiming they violated privacy guarantees
in the state constitution and violated state confidentiality laws according to the suit gerard helped the adl obtain access to confidential
files in law enforcement and government computers information from these files
were passed to the foreign governments the suit charges the whole concept of an organized collection of information based on
political viewpoints and using government agencies as a source of information is
absolutely repugnant said former rep pete mccloskey who is representing the
plaintiffs the adl s information gathering network was revealed publicly last week when
the san francisco district attorney s office released documents indicating the
group had spied on people and political and ethnic groups for more
than years my understanding is that they the adl consider all activity that is in
some sense opposed to israel or israeli action to be part of their responsbility
to investigate said arens a research scientist at the university of southern
california the adl believes that anyone who is arab american or speaks politically
against israel is at least a closet anti semite the fbi and the district attorney s office have been investigating the
operation for four months the plaintiffs in the case include arens the son of former israeli
defense minister moshe arens in a press release the plaintiffs said the alleged spying had damaged them
psychologically and economically and accused the adl of trying to interfere with
their freedom of speech"

public relations campaign about iran in recent months these include attempts to implicate iran in the bombing of the new york trade center despite great efforts in this direction they have not succeeded in this they however have indirectly created the impression that iran is behind the rise of fundamentalist islamic movements and thus are indirectly implicated in this matter public statements by the secretary of state christoffer and other official sources regarding iran being a terrorist and outlaw state and finally the recent broadcast of the frontline program i suspect that this pr campaign against iran will continue and perhaps intensify why this increased pressure on iran a number of factors may have
been behind this these include the rise of islamic movements in north africa and radical hamas movement in the israeli occupied territories this movement is basically anti western and is not necessarily fueled by iran the cause for accelerated pace of this movement is probably the gulf war which sought to return colonial shieks and amirs to their throne in the name of democracy and freedom also the obvious support of algerian military coup against the democratically elected algerian islamic front which clearly exposed the democracy myth a further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news on the slaughter of bosnian moslems possible future implications of this movement in saudi arabia and other us client states and endangerment of the cheap oil sources from this region a need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense expenditures this has become necessary after the demise of soveit union the recent pr campaign against iran however seems to be directed
from israel rather than washington there is no fundamental conflict
of interest between iran and the us and in my opinion it is in the
interest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal

story of dir yassin at that village whose name was publicized
throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties we had
four killed and nearly forty wounded the number of casualties was
nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers the arab
troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy the fighting
was thus very severe yet the hostile propaganda disseminated
throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian
population of dir yassin was actually given a warning by us before the
battle began one of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed
at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in arabic all women children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the
slopes of the hill by giving this humane warning our fighters threw
away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own
risk in the ensuing battle a substantial number of the inhabitants
obeyed the warning and they were unhurt a few did not leave their
stone houses perhaps because of the confusion the fire of the enemy
was murderous to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent
testimony our men were compelled to fight for every house to
overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades and the
civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable
casualties the education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of
revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war we
never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in
accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals i am
convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single
unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle but those who throw
stones of denunciation at the conquerors of dir yassin would do
well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency
found it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah whom mr ben gurion at a moment of great political emotion called the wise
ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country the wise
ruler whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion and flung the
bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal
superciliousness he rejected the apology and replied that the jews
were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of dissidents throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave
of lying propaganda was let loose about jewish attrocities the enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name in the
result it helped us panic overwhelmed the arabs of eretz israel kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the
haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting beit iksa was also evacuated these two places overlooked the main
road and their fall together with the capture of kastel by the
haganah made it possible to keep open the road to jerusalem in the
rest of the country too the arabs began to flee in terror even
before they clashed with jewish forces not what happened at dir
yassin but what was invented about dir yassin helped to carve the
way to our decisive victories on the battlefield the legend of dir
yassin helped us in particular in the saving of tiberias and the
conquest of haifa a footnote from the revolt pp to counteract the loss
of dir yassin a village of strategic importance arab headquarters at
ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story alleging a massacre by
irgun troops of women and children in the village certain jewish
officials fearing the irgun men as political rivals seized upon this
arab gruel propaganda to smear the irgun an eminent rabbi was induced
to reprimand the irgun before he had time to sift the truth out of
evil however good came this arab propaganda spread a legend of
terror amongst arabs and arab troops who were seized with panic at

75921.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"i will again repeat my statement i do not condone these indiscriminate israeli acts nor have i ever if the villagers do not know who these guerillas are which you stated earlier how do you expect the
israelis to know it is very difficult to identify who they are this is why the guerillas prefer to lose themselves in the general population by dressing the same acting the same etc i agree but because lebanon was either unwilling or unable to stop these
attacks from its territory should israel simply sit quietly and accept its
situation israel asked the lebanese government over and over to control
this third party state within lebanese territory and the attacks kept
occuring at what point does israel or any state have the right to do
something itself to stop such attacks never it is also the responsibility of any state to not allow any outside
party to use its territory for attacks on a neighboring state if angola
had the power and south africa refused or couldn t stop anti angolan
guerillas based on sa soil from attacking angola and south africa
refused to have un troops stationed on its territory between it and angola would angola be justified in entering sa if not are you saying that
angola had to accept the situation do nothing and absorb the attacks i refered above at all times to the palestinian attacks on israel from
lebanese soil not to lebanese attacks on israel one hopes that a lebanese government will be strong enough to patrol its border but there is no reason to believe it will be any stronger what has changed is that the plo was largely driven out of lebanon not by the lebanese not by syria and that is by far the most important making it easier to control future palestinian attacks from lebanese soil that change was brought about by israeli action the plo would never have been ejected by lebanese arab state or un actions i fully recognize that the lebanese do not want to be used by either side and have been and continue to be but the most fundamental issue is that
if a state cannot control its borders and make real efforts to do so it
should expect others to do it for them hopefully that other will be
the un but it is as we see in its cowardice regarding bosnia weak tim"

meeting the armenian reporter may pp athens greece an array of representatives of greek political parties including the ruling pasok party and a host of political groups both
armenian and non armenian joined to voice their solidarity with the armenian people in their pursuit of their cause and activities of a new
armenian political force were voiced here on sunday april during
the nd international meeting of solidarity with the armenian people and
judging from encouraging messages offered by the representatives of these
political groups and organizations at least here in greece the armenian
cause enjoys abundant support from a wide spectrum of the political world the international meeting of solidarity was sponsored by the greek branch of
the armenian popular movement a comparatively new political force headed
by younger generations of armenians who openly profess their support of the
armed struggle and of the armenian secret army for the liberation of armenia asala the organization has branches in various european and middle eastern
countries and the united states although some of these branches appear to
have gone through a switch of loyalties because of the split within the ranks
of asala voicing the support of pasok the ruling party in greece to the armenian
people was mr charalambidi michalis a member of the central committee of
the party and the greek member of the permanent people s tribunal explaining the goals and aspirations of the armenian popular movement was ara sarkisian significant was the address delivered by mr bassam abu salim on behalf of the popular front for the movement s continued support of the armenians armed struggle in their pursuit of their cause pledging that palestinian operated and run training camps would always be open to armenian youth who need training for such a struggle later mr abu salim answering a question put to him by this writer affirmed that his organization had always trained armenian members of asala and that
this policy will continue the doors of our camps are always open to armenian freedom fighters he affirmed among the prominent greek politicians who attended the conference was the son
of prime minister papandreou who himself holds a post in the greek cabinet two members of the cypriot parliament who had journeyed to athens for the
specific purpose of attending the international gathering representatives of
the christian democratic party edik center party two wings of the communist

european parliament and other members of the greek parliament were also among
those who participated in the international conference also on hand to follow
the deliberations was the ambassador of bulgaria in athens more than significant was the large number of messages received by the organizers including the following palestinian national revolutionary
movement fatah popular front for the liberation of palestine general
command the central committee of the palestinian national liberation
movement fatah the socialist progressive party of lebanon arab socialist
labor party the kurdistan democratic union of iraq and numerous other
international groups all noted for their radical stand in the israeli palestinian conflict support from arf rm among messages received from armenian groups was the armenian revolutionary
federation revolutionary movement the group that has claimed the abduction
and assassination of key party leaders in lebanon accused of selling out to
foreign interests and powers the message clearly gave its support to the
armenian popular movement pledging that the revolutionary movement will
continue to reveal the realities no matter how bitter or tragic they are to expose the anti armenian activities of the leaders of the dashnag bureau the message was taken as an indication of the link loose as it may be that
exists between the dissident dashnag group and the armenian popular movement open supporters of asala and armed struggle the armenian popular movement has set up its headquarters in a suburb of the
greek capital known as neos kosmos where there is a large armenian presence the headquarters are located in a two story building which appears to have
turned into a beehive of activity on the part of scores of armenian youth who
prefer to give their first names only when invited to introduce themselves now any comment from vedat dogan subject re addressing message id n crap posted by mr o boy please can you tell us why those quotes are crap because you do not like them because they really exist why as i said in my previous posting those quotes exactly exist in the source given by serdar argic you couldn t reject it here we go again in the book i have both the front page and the author s preface give the same year and january respectively anyone can check it at her his library if not i can send you the copies of pages please ask by sct i really don t care what year it was first published or what i care about is what the book writes about murders tortures et in

the internal and external news gives me that knowledge
and position in turkey had a democratic goverment and free
press at that time forget about internal news agencies i haven t
heard anything from any international source about any
concentration camps with greek cypriot prisoners in turkey however i heard adana pow camp it was not secret and well recognized pow camp i see they vanished in turkish labor camps turks have
decided to acknowledge their existence first but later
changed their minds releasing them is that it what do
you think happened to them i thought that mia s are only the subject of rambo and chuck noris movies seems that i am wrong you don t need to belive me turkiye was never a clandestine state
in its history it has been a respected and continuous member of un since the inception of un no body ever questioned the un membership of
turkey because of what had happened in a and after only a short lived arms embargo was imposed unilaterally by usa to satisfy the internal greek loby i know what you would say next let me answer it
before wasting anytime yes un had a few condemning resolutions against turkey because of handling the cyprus problem especially after
the coup well us and israel had a few too what can i say i am sure during athens junta duruing greeks had
their own share too have you looked at the latest un agenda for cyprus talks
mediated by gali there was no issue whatsoever about any
missing people among the negotiating parties was there i heard many times from denktas interviews by turkish and
international press he keeps saying that this was no
longer an issue for peace talks also you don t want
me fish for the greek cypriot politician s words that argic
had posted zillion times describing missing peoples as a greek cypriot myth seems that there is a different opinions among greek cypriots as well about missing people in turkish custody i am not claiming anything i just told you what was
given to greek cypriots as an answer by turkish
goverment turkish cypriots when they wanted to locate some
of their own between july and the final cease fire in
late august this answer seems to satisfy the international community the un and the vasilu goverment since he did not make it
an issue for the peace talks also i am not aware of any un
condemnation against turkey about any missing greek cypriot are you btw do you mean that nicos sampson had a bloodless coup d eta
and nobody got hurt in those events like i said before there is even a different opinion among
greek cypriots for this myth the officers in turkish army who
governed the adana pow camp must be hell of clever dudes
to cover up their tracks i hope turkish army does t have same type of morons for the security of turkiye however this must a good subject for a movie script one should inform oliver stone about this if this is what you understood from the paragraph above you better let your computer system administrator check

75961.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"i will try to answer some of dorin s questions even though they were
not addressed to me specifically but i feel that i am a bit concerned
by the thread since i am a southern lebanese from a village that is often on the receiving end of israel s bombs in the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied
lebanese terrritory is not an act of terrorism or murder it is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in munich
or any other act of terrorism or mrder this exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth it seems to me dorin that you are so remote and ignorant of the problem
on the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant and heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation i will try to paint the most accurate picture i can of
what the situation really is in south lebanon i am i was back in my home village this last summer for your information
we are people not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists most of the people in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily
business some work in the fields some own small shops others are
older men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee is that so hard to
imagine it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer
in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between to years are members of
the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often
suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are
supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and
ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps
for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured
by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages
of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians once they
are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where
an year old girl just happened to be we are now accustomed to israeli tactics and we figure that this is the israeli way of telling us that if you re gonna hurt our soldiers
you re gonna pay the price we accept this as a price we have to pay
to free our land israel knows very well that it is not really hurting
the resistance that much militarily with these strikes but rather
just keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young men to stop attacking israeli soldiers since these attacks are
taking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers israel s retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that
we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance
on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw the people of south lebanon are occupied or shelled by israel on a regular basis we do not want to be occupied if israel insists that
the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation
with the blood of its soldiers if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land we are not asking for the establishment of a lebanese occupied zone in northern israel to protect
our villages that are attacked on a regular basis by israel so the
best policy seems to be the removal of israeli occupation and the
establishment of peace keeping troops along the border i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only
real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace
settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and
peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure
no one on either side of the border is shelled this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to
realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting
its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more
israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel
would have resulted in if israel really wants to save some israeli lives it would withdraw unilaterally from the so called security zone before the conclusion
of the peace talks such a move would save israeli lives advance peace efforts give israel a great moral lift better israel s public image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations since israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in peace and has already offered some important concessions along with such a withdrawal israel could demand that hizbollah
be disarmed by the lebanese government and warn that it will not accept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a
shelling occurs than it will consider re taking the buffer zone
and will hold the lebanese and syrian government responsible for it there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese
goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is
capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did
in all other parts of lebanon i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing
cannot be qualified as murder no matter what you say i have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make yes we have no quarrel with jews or israeli civilians the real problem is with occupying israeli soldiers and those brave
israeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an occupying soldier is attacked basil"

control of any territory there must be two prerequsites one is that
it leads to a reduction in deaths the second is that it should not

75981.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the
opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search certainly the
people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the
innocent civilians into harm s way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel
should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attacking
another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects
innocent lives your damn right israel insists on some sort of demilitarized or buffer zone its had to put up with too many years of attacks from the territory
of arab states and watched as the states did nothing it is not exactly
surprizing that israel decided that the only way to stop such actions is to do it themselves what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will
only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way
israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence good lord brad what in the world goves you the idea that un troops stop
anything they are only stationed in a country because that country allows
them in it can ask them to leave at any time as nasser did in and somehow with that limitation on the troops powers i don t
think that israel is going to be any more comfortable without a genuine commitment to peace from the arab states and concrete not intellectual or political exercises in jargon guarantees by other parties the un is worthless
to israel but perhaps useful as a ruse perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is
the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting
against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups from israel s perspective concessions gets it nothing except the realization that it has given something up and now can only hope that the other side decides to do likewise words can be taken
back by merely doing so to take back tangible items land control of land requires the sort of action you say israel should
stay away from israel put up with attacks from arab state territories for decades before essentially putting a stop to it through its invasion of lebanon the entire basis of that reality was exactly as you state above israel would express outrage at these attacks and protest to the arab state involved that state promptly ignored the entire matter secure in the knowledge that it could not be held responsible for the acts committed by private groups israel would prepare for the next round of attacks what would israel want to return to those days and
don t be so idiotic as to suggest trust for the motivations of
present day arab states ah ok what is different about the present situation that tells
us that the arab states will not pursue their past antagonistic policies towards israel now don t talk about vague political factors but about those tangible just like that which israel gave up factors that guarantee the responsibility of those states your
assessment of difference here is based on a whole lot of assumptions and most states don t feel confortable basing their existence on that
sort of thing it has not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one sided and
selectively naive"
75982.eml,talk.politics.mideast,"snip in the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied lebanese terrritory is not an act of terrorism or murder it is disingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in munich or any other act of terrorism or mrder this exercise is aimed solely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth i agree that the death of three soldiers on a patrol etc is
not terrorism that having been said lets continue snip imagine it is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc i would not argue that all or even most of the villages are terrorist
camps there are however some which come very close to serving that
purpose and that is not to say that other did not function in that way
prior to the invasion some young men usually aged between to years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians once they are back they announce that they bombed a terrorist hideout where an year old girl just happened to be some of the villages and yours might well be among them are as you
describe not all are there are a large number of groups in the area backed by various organizations with a wide range of purposes hizbollah
and amal were two of the larger ones and may still be as to retaliation while mistakes may be made that is still a far cry from indiscriminate
bombing which would have produced major casualties israel s retalliation policy is cold hearted but a reality that we have come to accept and deal with the lebanese resistance on the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on occupying israeli soldiers until they withdraw this is the only real leverage that they have to force israel to withdraw well here we disagree i think that israel would willingly withdraw if
the lebanese gov t was able to field a reliable force in the area to police
it and prevent further attacks this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in actually that is not clear at all i will agree that the death toll is no
longer civilian and now primarily military though there seems to be very little incentive for the syrian and lebanese goovernment to allow hizbollah to bomb israel proper under such circumstances and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon no the syrian gov t is more than happy to have israel sink into another
lebanese morass i could elaborate if necessary i agree only in the case of the isareli soldiers their killing cannot be qualified as murder no matter what you say no but it is regretable as is the whole situation"

during the same terrible event on the night of the th of december my wife feride hasan
and i were paying a visit to the family of major dr nihat ilhan our neighbours mrs ayshe of mora her daughter ishin and mrs ayshe s sister novber were also with us we were all sitting
having supper all of a sudden bullets from the pedieos river
direction started to riddle the house sounding like heavy rain thinking that the dining room where we were sitting was
dangerous we ran to the bathroom and toilet which we thought
would be safer altogether we were nine persons we all hid in
the bathroom except my wife who took refuge in the toilet we
waited in fear mrs ilhan the wife of major doctor was standing
in the bath with her three children murat kutsi and hakan in her
arms suddenly with a great noise we heard the front door open greeks had come in and were combing every corner of the house
with their machine gun bullets during these moments i heard
voices saying in greek you want taksim eh and then bullets
started flying in the bathroom mrs ilhan and her three children
fell into the bath they were shot at this moment the greeks who broke into the bathroom emptied their guns on us again i
heard one of the major s children moan then i fainted when i came to myself or hours later i saw mrs ilhan and
her three children lying dead in the bath i and the rest of the
neighbours in the bathroom were all seriously wounded but what
had happened to my wife then i remembered and immediately ran to
the toilet where in the doorway i saw her body she was
brutally murdered in the street admist the sound of shots i heard voices crying help help is there no one to save us i became terrified i
thought that if the greeks came again and found that i was not
dead they would kill me so i ran to the bedroom and hid myself
under the double bed an our passed by in the distance i could still hear shots my
mouth was dry so i came out from under the bed and drank some
water then i put some sweets in my pocket and went back to the
bathroom which was exactly as i had left in an hour ago there i
offered sweets to mrs ayshe her daughter and mrs novber who
were all wounded we waited in the bathroom until o clock in the morning i
thought morning would never come we were all wounded and needed
to be taken to hospital finally as we could walk mrs novber
and i went out into the street hoping to find help and walked
as far as koshklu chiftlik there we met some people who took us to hospital where we were
operated on when i regained my consciousness i said that there
were more wounded in the house and they went and brought mrs ayshe and her daughter after staying three days in the hospital i was sent by plane to
ankara for further treatment there i have had four months
treatment but still i cannot use my arm on my return to cyprus greeks arrested me at the airport all i have related to you above i told the greeks during my
detention they then released me on foot into cyprus s devastated turkish quarter we went tonight into the sealed off turkish quarter of nicosia in

terrible sights in the kumsal quarter at no irfan bey sokagi we made our way
into a house whose floors were covered with broken glass a

children piled on top of their murdered mother in a room next to it we glimpsed the body of a woman shot in the

for physicians rather than for patients that in part complicates and undermines a simplistic free market analysis of the market for medical care once again there is no evidence that this is true in regard to kidney
dialysis although price controls have promoted an expansion of services
to a much greater volume of patients rd is still a profitable service otherwise one would expect to see evidence of rationing rather than the
vast expansion that has occurred can you spell loss leader i knew you could grocery stores do not
attempt to make up the loss on an individual product by selling more of
it in fact your argument above is that kidney dialysis is a loss leader for other medical treatments where lost revenue can be regained but the evidence does not support this contention rather it appears that
price controls have disciplined the market by forcing an expansion of
service and development of improved lower cost technology to provide comparable benefits providers continue to profit from rd they simply
make less on each treatment than they would have if the price had risen at the rate that uncontrolled treatments have there is no question that had price controls forced the price of rd substantially below its actual cost that some or all of the doomsday
predictions of free market advocates would have been seen restriction
of service lagging technological development etc likewise it appears
that in the va and armed forces medical care systems where providers are government agencies some of these negative impacts may occur rd patients in the va system in spokane for example must travel to
seattle miles away for treatment the bottom line however is that this is an example of government intervention of a rather extreme sort that appears to have had beneficial

income tax is illegal and or that ordinary working types do not have to
pay income tax and that they can legally avoid paying income tax with out declaring themselves to be churches or some such silliness this

have any merit whatsoever and the cases you ve cited involve such

applicable to anyone else or that they will ultimately stand on appeal

voluntary what you say no such case exists hmmm i wonder why

authority in the united states or any legitimate or illegitimate polit ical subdivision thereof is going to agree with your conclusions for that matter i confess i m thoroughly confused as to why you would
be looking for court rulings in your favor anyway since i thought you
told us earlier that every court in the us has been in cahoots with big

from men is different than protecting girls from men there are situations
in which boys and girls are apart from members of the opposite sex due to social convention or whatever and thus are safe in at least

children from abuse by members of the same sex if we can understand that it s not such a tremendous leap to suggest
that if we all think about it hard someone may come up with a
practical solution or even a partial solution to some of the situations

them by working together with good will on both sides we may be
able to start solving problems without restricting anyone s freedoms mr walz on the other hand is using rohit s post as an excuse for

large scale plantations slave labor was used to make one of the most valuable agricultural products of all more slaves in some ways this
treatment of humans beings as breeding livestock is the most horrifying
aspect of american slavery second although mechanization of cotton production could be expected to reduce the demands for labor eventually it was only in the s the mechanization of cotton production in the south largely eliminated the labor intensive character of the operation long after the first mechanical cotton reaper was invented this is an interesting question steinbeck s grapes of wrath published in the s uses agricultural mechanization of cotton

not humans they were outside our society and similar phrases that
basically meant that they didn t have to recognized as having the same
rights as a free person but they were never considered not human to
my knowledge like a horse that pulls a plow a slave s labor is the return on the capital required to purchase and feed him the parallel is so obvious i m not sure how you missed it after all its was the liberty to use their property as they saw fit that motivated southern planters to emphasize the importance of states rights if that were the case the slave states would not have passed so many

176903.eml,talk.politics.misc,"the argument that slavery was a dying institution was often made by is historians mainly southerners who sought to divert attention from the institution as the central issue of the civil war in fact however the argument is specious at best more recent scholarship from the last years demonstrates rather conclusively that the cotton sugar tobacco economy and its reliance on slavery was increasingly dominant in the south prior to the civil war this is because the south did not receive the massive momentum of capital intensive growth that the northern states did compare the northern agricultural system with the southern and you will see a major difference in the capital to labor intensity capital and labor are one and the same in a slave economy except that
capital doesn t reproduce quite as readily as slaves did slavery was a dying institution before the cotton gin yes but not
in it is true that cotton suffered from price depression in the s the period used to claim that slavery would not have lasted in the south that is not the argument that i have heard it would not have lasted because the growth in the north would not have been sustained for much longer without spilling over to the southern states i e northern industry would have migrated capital to the southern states and with that would have come immigrant labor to the ports of the south e g charleston savannah mobile new orleans etc this would have put the breaks on the slave market and slavery would have been out moded by the capital intensity of competing agriculturalists those that insisted on keeping slaves because of their cruel hearts and hatred for black people would have been driven out of business simple capital to labor ratio read michael parkin microeconomics nd edition and any other basic economics book this assumes that the slave holder dominance over state governments
would not have caused the passage of laws to keep out capital from the
north since slave holders were prepared to do almost anything else
to destroy free markets in order to maintain slavery i do not doubt
that they would have passed laws to cripple any serious competitive

maintenance of slavery and the costs it imposed on state and local

declaimed americans traditionally love to win they love a winner and will not tolerate a loser and so on the political implications are simple if as many socialists and

homosexuals tommorrow and yes indeed white men some yet to be determined
day when the balance of the pie has finally swung against that minority or you can just blow the whole thing off and say as do most

the notion of race into the discussion you muddy the waters without
adding any insight whatever the same parallel question could
be is a polydactyl person a human being you still have not
answered what you mean by human being please do so you won t answer the question and instead drag in irrelevancies if you want a definition of human being that does not depend on
the vagaries of law but holds solid whatever the law may rule provide it for me more irrelevancies as larry margolis pointed out the law
has made special exceptions in order to include fetuses but does
not follow your version of human being and as he pointed out brain death is not a means of determining who has the rights
of the living but rather who has died there is a significant
difference what i am wondering now is has your argument so failed you that
you feel it necessary to drag out irrelevancies and leave the
thread you started you got answers to your questions when
you began baiting me if you recall after you had made some
ridiculous remarks about adrienne regard and having been corrected changed the subject with your remarks about having a discussion
of substance if you really wanted a discussion of substance why then do you disregard logic and substance in order to toss
silly accussations e g it really doesn t matter to you if it matters to you then why not define human being and seek
some substance you re not going to convince a logical person
of the rightness of your position unless you apply some logic
and show some meaning to your words as others point out one is sacrificed for the other depending on
which has the better chance at survival again your analogy
fails not precedence but possession makes a difference here a woman s womb is indisputably her own also i see you ignore
my statement that you would grant rights to a fetus that would
not be granted a born human being was that due to its inconvenience is it please cite a precedent and the basis of the ruling you simply assert things without any support your analogy is
not accurate and your assertions are unsupported try this on
for size it is not murder for one siamese twin to kill
the other in the womb there we now have equal arguments but the idea is illogical for one siamese twin to kill the
other in the womb would likely be to kill itself as well the
systems are dependent on each other for life i m still struggling
to see anything analagous here and failing to do so your argument is from fantasy island your comparison is a total
failure as i have demonstrated already and has no basis in
reality neither legally nor medically and for you to assert
that it is not a perfect comparison because of the impossible that of coercion or oppression is ridiculous as i said you give the analogy too little credit for failure on the one
hand you start this by saying you want to take a real rather than
a hypothetical situation then you fly off into siamese twins
murdering one another in the womb or coercing or oppressing each
other in the womb when the reality of the situation you describe
in now way matches your version as i said before decisions
are made regarding which twin lives and dies in situations where
they cannot both survive and furthermore as i have already said there is a difference between an equal claim to organs and a claim
that is unequal you seem to be asserting that a fetus has a
claim on a woman s womb when the fetus is born what happens to
its claim and by what reason do you assert its claim you haven t answered the question the situations are not analagous again you avoid the question dependence can be transferred and
it is not as slow as you seem to think yes and i d hate to have been the one to tell dr gunn s children that
he was murdered by a religious pro life fanatic please do
try to stay relevant clever comeback i congratulate you on the readiness of your wit what happened to that claim to bodily organs where life is at stake why does this parent now have an indisputable right to his or her
kidney when previously the parent did not by your standards what
is different about the two situations i see i have to spell this
out for you since the meaning was too subtle for you in the one
case you do not recognize a difference between a fetus and a born
child you ask why a born child cannot be abandoned but a fetus
can and in this case you recognize a significant difference
between the fetus and born child where the lives of the two are at
stake you can t have it both ways action and inaction are
irrelevant to the principle but you are wrong about the inaction
anyway ask any of the numerous women who post here and have
borne children how inactive their pregnancy was to have a
healthy live child a woman does more than hang out eat as
she chooses plays volleyball like she always did drinks at
parties with her friends etc she behaves very differently and

against different classes of people and yes i do consider laws which
allow mandate enhanced penalties following conviction based upon the
convict s attitudes towards the class membership of the victim to fit
into that category the category of classes i had in mind was that of
the standard civil rights discussion classes based upon race gender ethnicity religion sexual orientation etc having you ask about
classes based upon one s profession rather than one s personal
characteristics caught me off guard and i had to think out the question
from scratch what i finally decided was that the law should not recognize such
classes because to do so would be to formally and officially declare
some people to be of more worth than others and that would be anathema
to the underlying american concept of equal treatment under the law last year when a federal crime bill was under consideration which would
have expanded the federal death penalty to an additional fifty plus
crimes including the murder of various federal officers hitherto not
protected by that aura of deterrence critics pointed out the
absurdity of having laws which made the death penalty available for the
murder of a federal postal inspector but not for ther murder of a
civilian teacher when the latter arguably provided a much more
valueable service and therefore would be the greater loss to society this was an emotionally compelling argument but even the proponents of
that viewpoint appeared to tacitly assume that the state should judge
some lives as being more valuable than others on the basis of their contribution to society i view that doctrine as being both a personally repugnant and b repugnant to the equal protection clause of
the th amendment accordingly i believe that there should be no laws which give any
profession based class of people special protection via the mechanism
of supplying stronger statutory deterrence of crimes against members of
that class not even police officers federal officers or high ranking

don t like what he says or thinks we have all seen the postings here by aj teel although many of us have
not agreed with their content i m sure most of us have been at least
somewhat interested in them i for one am greatful to live i thought in a country where people like mr teel are allowed to say what they please if i don t wan t to read it i can just skip on by or unsuscribe but unfortunately some people cannot let others live and let live they feel
an overwhelming need to snuff out the little bastards now it seems that
mr teel will be with us no more due mainly to our brother and cheif

for them to deal with they only ted and mark have complained to my
sysadmin some unknown number of times to get me off the net in his
defense mark sent only one message and it was not that bad it has
been posted in one of the newsgroups however it was not directed
at me as would be common practice and i am very good at responding
via netmail while i disagree with ted i would not send mail to his sysadmin
to get him axed name calling was not enough jumping on every post
i made was not enough ignoring specific points when they were not
what the desired picture was not enough simply ignoring me if i
am such a kook was not enough even now i do not wish to have him
axed but i do wish to express my disgust about this argumentum
ad silence your opponent um i would have thought he would have
wanted me to stay around just to have someone to yell about and
seem sooo wise to himself i think the issue that seems to be is the following an advertisement apparently ted and mark think so i posted an article from around one year ago as it was taken off the net from last year if reposting an article constitutes posting an ad then i am guilty this post did have a name and address and yes a price if one had posted the address and subscription price of newsweek would that be an ad i get nothing from showing this stuff i posted a list of documents showing examples of the kind of proof that was requested by ted frank he then complains to my sysadmin saying that i am advertising and lo and behold poof there goes my account this one had an address in it oh no i guess that means it is an ad if you value the alternative view i have been discussing or value
its discussion even if you do not agree with it i ask that you send
a note saying as much to me to show to the sysadmin they rarely get ya know that user on your net was real helpful or whatever they
only get i don t like what that user is doing because please do not send the note to the sysadmin i need to take it to them
in a manner that has at least a chance of getting through in my files here are hundreds of responses from people saying thanks for
the info or could you send me such and such or your posts are
very interesting keep it up and only a handfull of go aways but i guess the fact that i have decided not to waste my time trying to
convince ted is a net offense tm of such magnitude as to warrant
a message complaining about me knock knock my name is ted and
and this is mark we re from the thought police seems you have
some pretty dangerous ideas here and we re here to confiscate them nwo indeed guess i will have to go back to the drawing board and come up with
a new plan thanks ted and mike hope you are happy i will be on for a few more days and then that s all folks your comments and support are requested i can no longer post
to news i ask what this has accomplished is there some benefit
from making alternative views simply vanish not in my book seems the easiest way to win an argument is to make the opposing side
shut up images of waco ah but alas and all this when i am in the
process of typing in a letter to me from the tax collector saying that
a lien was removed due to a letter that i wrote challenging jurisdiction oh well it takes time to come up with the info requested and i
was just getting started it should be noted that ted frank has been accused publicly over times of being an nwo supporter and has never made an statements to the
contrary further what are ted frank s motivations for getting me axed we all know that some people are getting paid to collect info on people
on the net that are of interest to the government and ted sure seems
to have a personal interest in debunking me hmmm just who does

177001.eml,talk.politics.misc,"your statement is a common misconception but it just isn t true in the
german weimar system the chancellor was not necessarily the leader of the
largest reichstag party the chancellor was appointed by the president and
generally was the leader of a coalition of parties who could form an effective
majority in the reichstag beyond that the implication that hitler rose to
the chancellorship because a majority of germans wanted nazi rule is false
as well before president hindenburg appointed hitler chancellor in january the german people did not show a particular desire to be led either by
hitler or by the nazi party these are the results of the march election
for president the closest hitler ever came to direct election hindenburg hitler thaelmann duesterberg in the runoff election
in april the results were hindenburg hitler thaelmann so we can see that hitler personally was supported by only about a third of
german voters similarly the nazi party never received more than of the vote in
reichstag elections that occurred in july in the november election
the nazis lost two million votes and seats down from to out of
the in the reichstag comparitively the socialists had and the
communists the communists had gained seats and the german national
party which had supported the previous government had picked up a million
of the nazis lost votes to gain seats up to i think the other large
party was the catholic center party i don t know how many seats they had but
i think they were declining and there were numerous other small parties thus the nazi vote was on the decline at the time hitler was appointed
chancellor what brought hitler to power was not the demand of the german people for
hitler or the nazis to run things but the inability of the other parties to
put their differences behind them in favor of forming an effective government
for the country germany did not have an enduring democratic tradition and
their parliamentary system lacked effective center parties that favored the
interests of the majority of the population instead what they had was a
number of small parties who were unable to put aside their own specific
objectives in order to combine against the nazis who were out to end the
democratic process in fact part of the problem was that some of the other
parties with substantial representation like the communists were also
out to end the democratic process but with different results in mind and
generally didn t mind seeing parliamentary democracy go under germany had already had a non nazi chancellor with a majority coalition
for five months while the nazis had been the largest reichstag party and
there certainly was no danger of a revolution in favor of the nazis if anything the nazis were starting to get desperate because they had failed
to get enough support to make hitler president and their popular vote had
begun to decline hitler was not hindenburg s first choice to be chancellor not even his
second choice first von papen had been chancellor since june after
the november election when the nazis lost seats hindenburg first prevailed
on von papen to remain as chancellor but there were intrigues behind his back
and support for him was lacking so then hindenburg turned to von schleicher who became chancellor for two months eventually he too was unable to hold
together a working coalition of parties to oppose the nazis who refused to
participate in any government that was not led by a nazi chancellor some of
the nazi leadership particularly gregor strasser who was the man in the
party at the time wanted to participate in a coalition government but others knowing the party s support was waning figured that their best hope to gain
power lay in undermining the democratic process nevertheless the country
was governed for seven months by chancellors who were not nazis even though
the nazis were the largest reichstag party the failure of these men to
achieve a working coalition was due to the inability of their coalition
parties to work together here s how william shirer puts it in the rise and fall of the third reich the cardinal error of the germans who opposed nazism was their failure to unite against it at the crest of their popular strength in july the national socialists had attained but percent of the vote but the percent of the german people who expressed their opposition to hitler were much too divided and shortsighted to combine against a common danger which they must have known would overwhelm them unless they united however temporarily to stamp it out true the german people supported hitler after he became chancellor but
that doesn t change the fact that there was not overwhelming support for him before he was in power the german people were not crying out for hitler to
take over no matter how bad economic conditions were the leftist parties socialists communists probably had more support in total than the nazis hitler used the fact that others were passively or actively willing to see
the government paralyzed as a means to taking it over"

farther from being libertarian perhaps voluntary gifts would work if

even remotely looks like ours btw sometimes it seems that our government is trying to go the opposite direction it is not going to be
painless and not going to be easy we simply cannot wait to
help when they have the proper government they ll never
get there without the aid it may be too late already and i m just excercising mine as i also said above another problem i have is with transformation a libertarian society is not going to happen painlessly or overnight i have seen nothing about how to take our current government and
society and turn it into a minimal government and a responsible

monday april san jose mercury news page reproduced without permission year tradition still glows assimilation in u s threatens ancient zoroastrian religion by jeanne huber mercury news staff writer high on a hillside above san jose flames leap up hours a day from a
gleaming brass urn in a temple one of only four in the united states dedicated to one of the world s most ancient religions with the flames go the prayers of about bay area zoroastrians that
their faith will survive this land there is a fear a real fear too said silloo tarapore of lafayette we have one generation to do it or to die many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land but for zoroastrians it is an especially poignant concern their religion has been around for perhaps years a heritage so deep
it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where historical sites are
sometimes less than years old it was the religion of the great persian
empire under kings cyrus and darius and tradition says that when christ
was born about years later he was honored by a visit from three
zoroastrian priests the magi scholars say many key beliefs of christians jews and muslims can be traced to the teachings of zoroaster the
zoroastrian prophet yet with only about zoroastrians in the entire world they are a miniscule minority in every country in which they live survival as a
people is very much on their minds ironically local zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance
of the united states may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed
by nearly years of benign religious segregation could not do cause
their young people to stop thinking of themselves as zoroastrians zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion and they
actually shun the notion of trying to win converts so if their children
become totally assimilated they say it s their children rather than
the world at large who will be the losers it s important to have an identity said maneck bhujwaia of san jose a leader among zoroastrians who came here from india it s important
for everybody irish scottish americans it gives meaning to life you don t have to depend on the majority community to give you respect you can fall back on your own identity for zoroastrians there s much to be proud of their prophet zoroaster seeking to make sense of a culture in which
animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common preached that there was
only one god a good one zoroastrians call their god ahura mazda which
translates as lord of wisdom and light good vs evil zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil with
the good eventually winning men and women could join in the battle for
good he said and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences
such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong he preached honesty charity kindness to animals respect for the environment hard work equality of
men and women basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions but zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to
follow him blindly he demanded they think for themselves in fact joseph campbell the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths traced the western emphasis on individual thought to the zoroastrians zoroastrians have many words for thought their motto leaded into a
stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of
mount hamilton is good thoughts good words good deeds so it s not surprising that zoroastrians value education highly in india where a contingent of zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape
persecution by muslims in iran zoroastrians claim percent literacy the overall statistic in india is just percent about half of the bay area zoroastrian community came here from india
and pakistan mostly to study at universities the other half fled from
iran after the revolution made that a fundamentalist islamic state
where others had no rights local zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on good
deeds has improved life in every country they inhabit in san jose the recent restoration of the hotel sainte clarie came about because
manou mobedshahi a san francisco based hotelier passed the boarded up
downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple at the temple s
dedication the chief guest of honor was the mother of zubin mehta the
zoroastrian conductor of the new york philharmonic orchestra the temple exists because of another good deed the decision by an
iranian emigre the late arbab rustom guiv to buy land for six temples
in north america besides the acre site off crothers road on mount
hamilton he paid for land in los angeles chicago new york toronto and vancouver until his gifts there were no zoroastrian temples on
this continent local zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple and the
property already had a large house that they have converted to a
community center the temple dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet zoroaster is a simple structure with gleaming white walls vaulted ceilings and oak floors partially covered with huge oriental carpets its central feature is the fire set in the middle of a partly glassed in area at the center of the building although zoroastrians are sometimes called fire worshippers they actually consider fire just a symbol of god it helps us concentrate just like christians use the cross and muslims use the holy book bhujwala said the biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring for all
iranians including zoroastrians the new year begins on the first day of
the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life with
zoroaster s birthday just six days later the combination of religious
and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the
united states celebrates between christmas and jan for this year s celebration of the prophet s birthday about people
came to worship and revel the good things in life are not forbidden esfandiar anoushiravani a leader of the iranian members had said beforehand and what followed
proved him right inside the temple worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood
around the edges of the room as about a half dozen priests chanted
thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking
sandalwood glasses of milk and water and a tray heaped with dried fruit
and nuts kids crowded around grabbing handfuls of the treats people eat the
fruit tarapore said it s a way to participate in the ceremony santa claus sort of the gathering even had a santa claus iranian style with flowing white
hair and a bag of gifts for the children this amownaroz wore green
symbolic of spring and red he was ushed in by a sort of spring clown hajefyrouz who danced and
played a tambourine the zoroastrians from india were charmed this is all new for us too one told a visitor who asked what was going on a visitor john a sabanovich of folsom said he became intrigued with
the religion years ago while on business trips to iran zoroastrians have
no procedure for accepting converts a result some say of their
centuries of persecution in iran followed by their promise to the hindu
king who allowed them into india that they would not interfere with his
people s religion but that does not stop sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the
san jose temple whenever he can when i first heard about this religion he said i thought my god this is what a religion should be they think for themselves and do good people who don t have a tradition something to lean on what s the
difference with the lower animals end of article"
82778.eml,talk.religion.misc,"i agree which is why i ve asked for help with it the reason i m working on this list is because i ve recently had one
too many christians tell me the bible contains no contradictions
whatsoever they believe that it s true and that it describes
reality perfectly and even predicts history before it happens before i can carry on any sort of meaningful conversation with these
people i ve got to show them with concrete evidence that the bible
is not nearly as airtight as they thought i hope to do that with
this list specifically when i bring up the fact that genesis contains two
contradictory creation stories i usually get blank stares or flat
denials i ve never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are
indeed two different accounts of creation"
82779.eml,talk.religion.misc,"isn t that interesting in the jewish tradition you are incredibly
wrong they originate in the torah and with jewish ancestors specifically the patriarch abraham z l that knowledge was sent east
to india and china when abraham gave gifts the commentators to jewish
scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts to all the rest
of his children when he sent them away to the east this assured that
isaac only who remained with abraham would inherit his most important
spiritual gifts what eventually became judaism so you see other religions can have very parochial views too by the
jewish view you are very mistaken your scripture are not scripture your gods are not gods your practices a jumble of errors that lead
people to idol worship and away from god that doesn t stop us from
respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize
you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner we re content
to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be we
are happy to co exist as long as you give us the same right but your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that too bad is this typical of your religion you are a most presumptuous fellow how dare you presume that the typical new ager doesn t acknowledge god and is selfish what trite self righteous ego ful garbage there are buddhists christians jews and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your
words are simple slander of course from the jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong we d
say that there is no godhead just created beings who may be
enjoying a good laugh at your expense so not only are we selfish we are also thieves and liars and you
expect any of us to pay attention to you and your religion why not
call us more name maybe then we ll all convert in gratefullness you delude yourself"
82781.eml,talk.religion.misc,"hudson if someone inflicts pain on themselves whether they enjoy it or not they are hurting themselves they may be permanently damaging their body that is true it is also none of your business some people may also reason that by reading the bible and being a xtian
you are permanently damaging your brain by your logic it would be ok
for them to come into your home take away your bible and send you off
to re education camps to save your mind from ruin are you ready for
that hudson and why is there nothing wrong with it because you say so who gave you the authority to say that and set the standard for morality why because i am a living thinking person able to make choices for myself i do not need you to show me what you think is the way i have observed
too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the
rules for me because i set the standard for my own morality and i permit you to do the same for yourself i also do not try to force you to accept my rules because simply because you don t like what other people are doing doesn t give you
the right to stop it hudson we are all aware that you would like for everyone to be like you however it is obnoxious arrogant thinking like yours the i know i m morally right so i can force it on you bullshit that has brought us religious wars pogroms against jews gay bashing and other atrocities by other people who like you knew they were
morally right me hudson aren t you aren t you indicating that i should not tell other people what
to do aren t you telling me it is wrong for me to do that it is not a moral standard that i am presenting you with hudson it is
a key to getting along in life with other people it is also a point of
respect i trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their
own choices and i expect the same to be returned you on the other
hand do not trust them and want to make the choice for them whether
they like it or not it is also a way to avoid an inconsistency if you believe that you have the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives then you must by logic admit that other people have the same right of interference in your life yes i know you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that
only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference however other people will say that you have misinterpreted the word of
god and that they are the actual true believers and that you are
acting on your own authority and so it goes hudson who gave you the authority to set such a moral standard for me to tell me that i cannot set a moral standard for others you can set all the standards that you want actually but don t be surprised
if people don t follow you like rats after the pied piper at the most basic form i am not going to let you tell me what to do and if necessary i will beat you to a bloody pulp before i let you actually
interfere in my life now at a more humane level than that i recognize that all people are
sentient beings possessed of intelligence and capable of reason i also
recognize that they like i appreciate being treated with respect and
allowed to make their own decisions"
82782.eml,talk.religion.misc,"hudson me hudson so why is someone elses will such a big deal if morality is all relative i don t believe i ever said that morality was all relative what i said was that i can make my mind up on my own thank you and that you don t have the right to tell others what to think i think that you will find that in most moral systems there is a respect for human life and the dignity of the person it is all the
stuff besides these points that forms the core of the disagreement between primitive moral absolutists like yourself and the rest of us hudson maybe the insane lover of pain might reason if other people experienced enough pain they might learn to enjoy it too fine there is still the clinical definition of crazy and this also
involves a violation of free will because the insane lover of your
little example would be inflicting pain on a non willing subject try again hudson me hudson you have to have some sort of premise about choice or self awareness no you do not i demonstrated to you the example of the football
team which doesn t require premises about freedom of choice or sentience self awareness as i said you are wrong and you don t seem to know much about moral systems if i were you i would take david bold s suggestion and do some reading on the subject before you try preaching about it"
82783.eml,talk.religion.misc,"hudson yes you do who is to say that it is immoral for onesself to experience pain or to be hurt in some other way maybe unpleasant but that doesn t say anything about morality it violates free will hudson me hudson why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral hudson you are screwing up again morality does not i say again does
not define only right and wrong it also defines acceptable social
behavior without any overtones of good and evil picking up your trash
is not really a right wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of good
and evil yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social
behavior your definition of the word morality is what is causing you to trip over yourself here me and since i selfish being that i am want to maximize my gains from society i will not do anything to another member of society if that action might cut down on how much benefit i can derive from society hudson why is your benefit somehow related to morality again your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot hudson what about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society maybe something might hurt society but it would help him immensly that is irrational thinking there may also be people out there who think that death by atomic destruction is a sublime and wonderful thing i am not going to let them
execute that idea just because they want to do it simply because i let people make up their minds about what morals they
have doesn t prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when i see
one hudson and even then i will only stop him when he interferes with me and my life that is the difference between me and you you
want to interfere in people s lives even when they aren t affecting
you hudson the central character in dostoevsky s novel crime and punishment r something or other reasoned that if killed this old jewish woman and stole her money to educate and establish himself financially he could make a great contribution to society he reasoned that she was not of much profit to society she just collected rents and hoarded money one of the central points of any that s any moral system is that is
has to be internally consistent by killing her the character had to accept the premise that the ends
justify the means if he accepted that premise then in order to be
consistent he must accept the idea that some day another person may
apply the same standard to his life now if he is unwilling to accept
this premise which he will not be willing to accept then he has
behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard me football example deleted hudson now suppose a freshman on the bench will only get to play if one of the players in the field on the court is injured or killed this freshman wants to play in the big game so a talent scout can see him if he hurts a player on the team it might slightly lessen the chances of the team to win but he might gain great personal benefit so operating on purely selfish immorally selfish motives he arranges for a sniper to shoot a team player in the leg he gets to play in front of the talent scout did that freshman behave morally selfish intentions may sometimes generate apparently moral actions but not always two problems right off the bat the problem with your analogy is that it doesn t address the goal
that i started with winning the game playing in front of the talent
scout winning the game try creating the same analogy and keep the
ultimate goal the same will you the internal consistency question is also not addressed if the freshman
wants to do this to other people then he has to accept the fact that
it may happen to him one day if he is unwilling then he has violated
his own moral standard"
82784.eml,talk.religion.misc,"hudson if all morality were relative big hairy deal as i said you appear to be the only person saying that all morality
is relative most people i know do hold some absolutes in their
moral system i personally believe that the dignity of the individual and the right
of free will are absolutes i recognize that there are some moral
systems around which don t accept this i reject them as dangerous
and anti social nazism some forms of communism fundamentalist
xtianity no that s not a slam but for the most part almost
every moral system agrees on these two points me hudson generally christians believe in a creator creation distinction other religions believe in one big whole i don t accept yor premises too bad i know i m right so i get to enforce my view upon you whether
you like my premise or not and since you can t prove otherwise there
isn t even an intellectual basis for your resistance to accepting my
viewpoint hudson i don t think so once morality becomes relative it degenerates i am saying that reasoning that it is generally evil to hurt other people is bad though i don t think it is sufficient well then answer me this you seem to be opposed to moral relativism as you call it because it has the capacity to degenerate obviously then you would advocate a nonrelative absolute moral system whose absolutist moral system do we choose how do we come to this decision what about people who disagree with the chosen moral system hudson but if morality is considered to be relative and this rule isn t based on anything but is just an arbitrary rule people might abandon it fine i can agree with most of what you typed here however just because
morality gets based on something nonrelative does not mean that we have to
pick your xtianity as its base we can start a morality based on dignity of humans freedom of choice tolerance etc and never ever rely on xtianity for anything just because
someone has a consistent moral system based on true principles does not
mean that they have to involve xtianity in it xtianity certainly does not
have a monopoly on principles of behavior indeed fewer religions are
guiltier of violating their own principles"
82785.eml,talk.religion.misc,"me hudson why does that make something immoral because you are not being consistent moral systems must be consistent a person who thinks they can inflict pain on others but doesn t want it inflicted upon themselves has a double standard and double standards are
a violation of any moral system me hudson of course we don t like pain i don t like brussel sprouts are brussel sprouts immoral pain isn t immoral stupid pain itself is just a physiological
reaction what is nature is not a sentient force there is no choice involved therefore no question of morality hudson i actually heard a geologist entertain the notion that matter had a will there is some sentient force out there fine i have also heard that the government is encoding the dna for a new race of superhumans in ordinary drinking water what s your point hudson if humans are made only of matter then choices are also chemical reactions so why is choice an important issue and if that is the case then god is only an idea contained in the minds
of people formed of matter and on printed pages also formed of matter and does not really exist i can do the argumentem ad absurdium just as well as you can but it won t prove any points for you or me got anything relevant you want to talk about or are you just playing cute little games"

of the nicene creed and its status as devine and inspired i say no good because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not the authors of the creed were inspired i leave you it will be some time before i post again with the following thought authored by eugene england professor of english at brigham young university mr england wrote the following as part of a book review section in this people s magazine spring edition i conclude with a little sermon because i believe we will not be a mormon or human family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other with terms like feminist or patriarchal liberal or conservative christian or non christian hal when we are tempted to draw a circle around a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it american then exclude those who don t fit it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central defining characteristic of a good american might be one who doesn t draw exclusive circles that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the central american ideal is by excluding others and when we are tempted to draw a circle around mormon or christian to decide who is orthodox and who isn t by how much they agree with us it might be well to consider that the central pillar of christ s orthodoxy is our ability to love unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family i recently spent some time in a christian bookstore in california the service was excellent the clerks and customers all smiling neat and well scrubbed and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural commentaries sentimental fiction and collections of evangelistic sermons but i was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking others often viciously whether the political left our modern american culture or other religions a whole section was devoted to cults and the occult and as you might expect mormonism was right there under the same rubric and indictment often by the same authors as satanism and i found i could either rent or buy in english or spanish copies of the god makers that absurdly inaccurate even libelous but very popular and dangerous anti mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations of the nazi films that scapegoated jews in the s it seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety perfect love casteth out fear i john i have always been pleased that the lds church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths though i find a disheartening increase in willingness of individual mormons to engage in the same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating and even threats of coercive action as the religious right wing has launched this year against the political left and american cultural and religious styles they don t like it is a fearful irony that in so doing mormons take common cause with the very people who have most slanderously attacked mormons people who would if they had power forcefully restrict mormons rights along with those of others they believe to be evil the above sermon was addressed to the lds audience who usually subscribe
to this people s magazine but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of jesus christ to bring us back into his
arms even though the lds church claims devine authority to exercise the principles of the restored gospel as in the days of christ the church does not claim perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do now lead the church i for one do not wish to be labelled christian if those who profess themselves as christians attack my beliefs because they are intollerent for example of the way my religion may interpret biblical scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication than mainstream christianity would give it once again being in the majority does not in and of itself prove anything except that your collective voice is louder that s really all the critics of the lds church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of biblical interpretation used as proof to counter the lds church interpretation using someone elses biased research of truths and non truths whose to say what the mixture is as an authoritative tool to disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone least of all themselves let us simply agree to disagree and share beliefs through adult discussion and conversation thereby uplifting everyone hal leifson signing off"

mankind is absolute it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common
moral system created by mankind is sensible in fact for the bible to be of
any use to mankind as a moral code it must be interpreted by mankind and a
workable moral system created for everyday use the jewish talmud is the result of centuries of biblical scholars analysing
every word of the torah to understand the morality behind it the children of
israel were given a very strict set of moral civil judicial and ceremonial
laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance
of moral dilemma in their society for a christian the situation is no better it seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the judeo christian god is that which is contained in the bible which we can see from
the diverse opinions in the christian newsgroups is not clear there may well
be an absolute morality defined by the judeo christian god for mankind to
follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was
written down by man this leads to the problem of defining morality for our society if we take the
divine morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many
different ways as an example consider the immolation of heretics in the
fifteenth century and the interpretation of the bible which allows a man to do
that to another man under the precept to administer justice if we take an
agnostic morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit
society with all the danger that this implies alternatively we could take
the basis of the judeo christian morality and interpret extend this to create
and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables
the people to live righteously as many christian and non christian philosophers

82801.eml,talk.religion.misc,"the primary problem in human nature is a fragmentation of being humans are in a state of tension a tension of opposites good and
evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind the bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of
being the warring opposites within us are a product of man s
rebellion against god which is described so vividly in the pages of
the scriptures man was created with the order to become a god those were the words
of st basil in the fourth century what he was trying to say was
that god created man to be a partaker of the divine nature in the
eastern orthodox church this is called theosis or deification one can also say that man was created to be whole i e spirit soul and body operating in unison the story of adam and eve is a picture
of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness theirs
was a harmonious relationship with each other the world and the
creator that innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed god their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly
irreconcilable halves immediately guilt and fear was manifested in
their lives they become bound to hardship toil and suffering this
is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state the beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness if it
were to receive this self awareness the knowledge of good and evil its paradisiac state would also be destroyed was it the intention of the creator to leave man in this state of
innocence all the days of his existence on earth or was the gaining
of self awareness carefully staged by god who did not desire that his
masterpiece mankind be a blissful idiot god must have known that for mankind to achieve any kind of moral
value he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites there
is no other way to achieve union with god jesus christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities he was the perfectly integrated individual reconciling the opposites and making it possible for us to be integrated i e to become god not in his essence but in his energies the opposites is the christian problem the apostle paul describes it
with the utmost precision in romans and he follows with the
answer to his dilemma in vs mark"

acts for lot is kleros not chorion as stated by mr archer and nowhere
in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to theological dictionary
of the new testament by bromley is the meaning burial plot discussed it
discusses the forms of kleros eg kleros kleroo etc and the various
meanings of kleros eg plot of land and inheritance but mentions
nothing about chorion or burial plot why does this not surprise me thus

82813.eml,talk.religion.misc,"i produced an error last week about chorion i abhor publishing trash i abhor it of myself even more than i do from
others but since i do not present myself as an authority on the subject i do
not feel dishonest though i do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in
this example thus i felt honor bound to do a better set of research
specifically on the word first it should be noted that greek grammar is not
as tough as i first assumed it is not nontrivial by any means and i still am
not competent with it but it is not as opaque as i had thought it turns
out that while the index for the bauer arndt gingrich greek lexicon renders
each verse in order each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical
order thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable the syntax is
far from clear on the other hand a greek english intralinear bible makes
things a lot more comprehendable and yes the word for field in acts is
indeed chorion now i ve checked several greek english lexicons greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian writings bauer arndt gingrich the new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher in each case the meaning of the word chorion was given variously as a space place region district field area country place land farm estate a bit of tillage and similar meanings nowhere do any of these books mention anything about grave as some of these books go into great detail i would be very surprised to find that these books are all inadequate and mr archer is the only competent scholar in greek i think it more likely that mr archer s investigations into contradictions to be once again as your friend said it lacking in substance and thus archer is again shown worthless as an expert witness by the way mr decenso i would have honorably presented my results on this matter even if i had found them
to support mr archer s contentions by the way among these lexicons eg robinson s is the definition of agros the word used in matthew to describe the field bought the word agros is defined as a field in the country chorion is specifically noted
as a synonym to agros this is significant as it is evidence of how silly
bullinger s exegisis was which stated that the word for field in matthew ie agros is different from the word for field in acts ie chorion and
thus we must be talking about two different fields of course you already
admit how stupid bullinger s exegisis is but this was a small serendipity
which drives the point home so as of now unless mr decenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise eg a reputable scholar with reputable references i consider this particular issue closed see mr decenso now you can go on to answer
questions about the denials of peter the day of the crucifixion tyre and the fact that the author of matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in
discussing the potter s field later dave butler precise knowledge is the only true knowledge and he who does not teach exactly does not teach at all henry ward beecher american clergyman as recorded by george seldes"
82814.eml,talk.religion.misc,"mr decenso in spite of requiring scholarly opinion on the hanging of judas rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases
those scholars opinion on the subject and actually if you do further research as to the greek word apacgw you will
find that it does denote success those scholars did indeed have an excellent
reason to assume that the suicide was successful as i pointed out i
recently checked several lexicons greek english lexicon of the new testament louw and nida robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new testament greek english lexicon of the new testament grimm word study concordance tynsdale a greek english lexicon of the new testament and other early christian writings bauer arndt gingrich the new analytical greek lexicon perschbacher a couple simply stated hanged oneself and a couple were more explicit and stated that apacgw means specifically kill yourself by hanging a
couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for apacgw is strangle throttle or choke which pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested to david joslin that judas was hung upside down one of the best
references though robinson s greek and english lexicon of the new
testament not only stated the translation it gave both the root words the
literal translation related greek words which use the same roots and also
other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature to give
further context the word apagchw has two root words gchw is the to strangle root and
the root word apo means literally away this root words is included in
words which denote a transition it can mean a transition in place eg the
greek word apagello means to send a message apo can also denote a
change in state and specifically the change from life to death robinson
specifically makes comparison to the word apokteiuo which means to kill in literal meaning the word apacgw means to throttle strangle to put out
of the way and implicitly denotes a change in life state ie away from
life to death so while the word apacgw does mean to hang it
specifically denotes a death as well thus robinson is quite specific when he
state that it means to hang oneself to end one s life by hanging he then
notes the the use of apacgw in homers odessy to denote context he
presents that example of apacgw as being used to explicitly mean suicide by
hanging now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling without the
added denotation of death and as you insist that the bible was written by
god and every word is precicely correct you are stuck with the complete
meaning of apacgw ie since the word apacgw was used then death is
denoted as the result by the way i note that mr decenso also presents an example of apacgw note mr decenso as you say the septuagint was a translation from hebrew to
greek and you have not shown the original meaning of the hebrew ie the the
hebrew say and died and thus whether it was simply echoed in the greek it should also be pointed out that regardless of the added and died the
correct translation would still be apacgw as the man did indeed die from
strangulation redundant but correct further we have evidence that the
septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited which included versions
which contradicted each other and such editing was not even necessarily
executed by greeks thus i am not sure that you can use the septuagint as it
now stands as a paragon of ancient greek so what you really need to prove
your point mr decenso is an example in ancient greek of someone committing apacgw and surviving otherwise i would see you as simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding evidence now i would note mr decenso that everytime i go out of my way to research it
one of your apparently contrived exegisis i pretty much find it false thus i think that if you are going to add to the text something over and above
what the source clearly says then you had better have an explicit greek or
historical source to justify it by the way as to mr rose s statement about trees around the potter s field unless mr rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old or that
there are year old stumps there or has a thousand year old description
of the area which mentions such trees then it is inappropriate for him to
assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
thousand years ago after all things change now as to your other argument ie that the money judas used is not the same
as the silvers true peter or the author of acts does not specifically call judas betrayal an iniquity but for that matter neither does john specifically call judas actions an iniquity either further john did not say that judas took
the money box but rather said some thought that because judas had the money box jesus was telling him buy what we need for the feast or that he should give something to the poor so after receiving the morsel he immediately went out and it was night note that it is said that judas left it does not say that he took the money
box thus when i see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
the a an unproven iniquity mentioned by another author in a different
book written at a different time over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
the author of acts i find this forced and contrived of course this particular argument becomes moot since we have have seen
evidence that apacgw means suicide you see since judas hanging was
successful he could not have spent the money mentioned in john because
matthew and mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day ie passover and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next day thus the money which bought the field of blood would have to
have been the pieces of silver of course he got the pieces of silver
that night as well and thus couldn t have spent that either oh dear i
believe that the house of cards is comming down maybe we should at this point discuss now whether jesus was crucified on
friday or saturday as that is now part of the argument about judas by the way as to where the prophesy of the potter s field came from ie the
mention of it in matthew you say i am reminding you now to discuss it now it s all part of the same verse we
are discussing and i wish you would quit procrastinating and sidestepping these issues later dave butler a wise man proportions his belief to the evidence david hume philosopher an inquiry concerning human understanding ps i would note again that you are not stating that that bible is not possibly inerrant you are stating that it is inerrant since you have been by your own admission presenting merely possible reconciliations i of course don t rate them that highly then the best you can do is say that the bible is possibly inerrant not that it is inerrant"

of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see
straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious
moral decisions based on reality if a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own he is not
considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone this man has
fled his responsibility has behaved like a lazy coward and has turned
away from his responsibility to his wife and child however if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden she is not thought of in the same way when the man abandons the woman
suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life when the woman abandons the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed
out and the man has no choice and the man sometimes suffers so badly that
he wishes he could trade places with his child ths root of this whole problem is selfishness the arrogance that says my
feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung and when you come down to it this is the substance of what hell is made of it s the reason a loving god can throw selfish people to the devil and his
demons for all of eternity let any one of us unrepentant into heaven and

responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight the media
backs us completely real responsibility does not sell the only responsibility that sells in the marketplace is that which is just
enough to make us feel responsible without showing anything that
might show us our own true irresponsibility we want to feel like
good people but we want nothing with being good people just give
me the freedom to say i m good and the rest of the world can burn rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where
poor old folks rot until they re dead i ll hate my brother and sister

exports of glassware wine white marble and dyed cloth that tyre along with other seaports provided outlets for south arabian indian
and even chinese trade that tyre had to accomodate its growing
population by following a perpendicular rather than horizontal line
of growth because it was running out of land to build on that tyre
established colonies of its own none of this sounds like a small

economy if tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present why is it always called a city or above a major city why
does it show up on all the maps when population figures for cities

may even use cars these days the encyclopedia britannica says pop est most other references give figures in the thousand range one atlas gives the population of tyre as the same
source give comparatively high figures for sidon and beirut also so i doubt that it is a typo perhaps these were figures for
the cities and their surrounding areas i don t doubt that the
population of tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades in
particular the israeli military action hurt tyre quite a bit i thought you were talking about times that tyre was destroyed don t most if not all of these apply not just to tyre but to the other cities in the area sidon for example can you make

awards the a prayer a day keeps the lust away citation as director of free
indeed a national ex gay ministry caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians a way out of the homosexual death style through prayer i d like to give the award back caligiuri now laughs i m
no longer deserve it caligiuri s eight year involvement with the national ex gay movement peaked
with his founding of the phoenix chapter of homosexuals anonymous ha as well
as free indeed he has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception there s no reality
in it he says i was selling a product and my product was a lie headed up by national ministries like exodus international and courage the
organizations of the ex gay movement rely on the tenents of born again
christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals usually young gay men who
are just coming out that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing christianity we offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality explains bob davies director of
exodus he ventures that about of those seeking to abandon their homo sexuality are men anybody who is involved in the ex gay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time says lisa seeley a former redeemed lesbian who worked with
caligiuri as ha and appeared with him on the sally jessy raphael show these
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded it s possible to change your identity or your behavior says sex educator
brian mcnaught author of on being gay but it s really impossible to
change your orientation these people are no longer calling themselves gay but they continue to have same sex erotic feelings caligiuri says he founded free indeed after an ominous week in when all
hell broke loose in his personal life a few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar i was really drunk he recalls and i
went home with this guy he tied me up and raped me he left me tied up all
night and the next morning he raped me again when caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker he returned home to the
home he shared with his ex lover he had another man there with him caligiuri recalls i thought at this time if this is what being gay is
about i don t want to be this way anymore caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out he would share his discovery
with others he organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at phoenix s
gay pride parade in june and a few months later free indeed held its
first public protest at a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance free indeed members loudly blasted gays telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell free indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages we were listed
under lesbian and gay alternative services caligiuri says so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard people would call to find out
where the local bars were and we d preach to them about the sins of homo sexuality ruses like this are typical of the movement caligiuri says adding they ll do anything to reach these people david used to go on radio and say really stupid things recalls peter
kelly a counselor at phoenix s catholic diocese aids program like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors caligiuri s family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
raphael s syndicated talk show in they were relieved he recalls they figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family better
that i should be a reformed gay person but caligiuri was hardly reformed by the time i appeared on sally s
show i d started having sex with men again men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin sex with their pastor sex with their
father i was horny all the time unable to risk going to gay bars where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances caligiuri says he used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs when he wasn t working the bookstores he was sleeping
with other reformed homosexuals i didn t realize it at first but a lot of the ha leaders were having sex
with one another caligiuri says we d go to conferences in other cities and we d be paired up in hotel rooms everybody was sleeping with everybody
else by the time he appeared on am philadelphia television show in may caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week when the show s
host asked him if he ever acted on temptation his answer was a lie caligiuri s duplicity began to take it s toll on him however he was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis a dibilitating
yeast infection and this led to his escape from the sect i was too sick
to go to church he explains the more time i spent away from those people
the more i began to feel like myself i began to remember who i used to be late in caligiuri turned free indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry s doors i d convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for ex gay people he says today caligiuri is studying alternative spiritualities i m interest ed in belief systems that aren t judgemental considering romance but
not with a christian and searching for a new project to devote himself to i feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes he says i want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what i did and make up for the damage i
may have brought to our community end article caligiuri s tory is by no means unique and i have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of ex gay ministries who have said very similar th
similar things fortuantely not all of them have left christianity but have
come to realize that god loves them despite the attitudes of others some like chris glaser director of the presbyterian lazarus project of west
hollywood presbyterian church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay i have also as i said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as love in
action and others who either once claimed to have been reformed or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie no matter who was disappointed
in them some were even encouraged to marry as a way of sealing their
new heterosexuality only to eventually start hitting the bars bathhouses
and bookstores since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and one night stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous sin through a committed relationship this is a horrible trap which the church
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people and the very inno cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people heterosexuality or celebacy this is sad what is also
mrtifying is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them they may even opt for suicide or surgical dampering of the brain
functions in the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common place there are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive christianity toward gays such as sylvia pennington s ex gays there are none and others there are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
maury johnston s gays under grace and chris glaser s come hom i

for years were involved with the organization from to the
program was described by these men as ineffective not one person was
healed they stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent
feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees many were
driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed reparative therapy the previous article quoted in the last posting is from the advocate june called the ex ex gay by robert pela some personal thoughts it is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major
portion of the church to control and mandate change of a minority among
its ranks this was the momentum behind the spanish inquisition only all
they required was a confession of faith after much torture and then to
save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death even
later the bible was used vigorously to defend slavery oppression and
segragation of african americans even to the justification of lynchings today s scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach the tool is
still coersion but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind
control convincing people that they should see themselves as less than
god sees them then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt
thier mind conditioning is complete sure no one is physically forced
to stay in this reparative therapy but sheer social pressure is enough for
many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self hate as an abolitionist i advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution

even though it is not detectable your description of the unbilical took me three passes to understand but
i get the gist and i have to tentatively agree i think our two definitions
can sit side by side without too much trouble though i haven t attempted to
define the reason behind the moral driver only hinted through the essence of
each moral your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
similar morality simians have a similar social order to ourselves and it is
easy to anthropomorphize with these animals is this possible or have i
misunderstood my p s thoughts falls roughly in line with john stuart mill and
his writings on utilitarianism i have no particular plan except to do
my bit personal ethics and social work my opinion for what it is worth is that the authority for each moral must be increased somehow and that this
will probably take several generations to be effective i don t think that the
list of morals has changed for society significantly though the authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models see eric berne and his
transactional analysis work mavis klein for references and this is what
gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term i ve had some more thoughts on my definitions i ve was thinking that i should add moral character to the list of definitions
in order to get a dynamic version of the moral nature ie the interplay of
the moral code and associated authorities a suitable analogy might be a
graphic equaliser on a hifi system the moral nature being the set of
frequencies and the chosen amplitudes and the moral character being the
spectrum over time conscience is a little more difficult because i can t define it as the
reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his moral nature
because conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
unwanted i think conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
time which compromises one s moral nature my conscience fits in more with
freud s superego plus the moral driver with the stimulous being the
urges or freud s id the reasoning that i mentioned before is freud s ego i suppose if the moral driver is part of the id then the reason why
conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained the question is what
provides the stimulous to activate the moral driver i think i need some

83457.eml,talk.religion.misc,"yep that s pretty much it i m not a jew but i understand that this is the
jewish way of thinking however the jews believe that the covenant between
yhwh and the patriarchs abraham and moses in this case establishes a moral
code to follow for mankind even the jews could not decide where the boundaries
fall though as i understand it the sadducees believed that the torah was all that was
required whereas the pharisees the ancestors of modern judaism believed that
the torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of
the required morality in all its nuances talmud the essence of all of this is that biblical morality is an interface between
man and yhwh for a jew or christian and does not necessarily indicate
anything about yhwh outside of that relationship although one can speculate the trouble with all of this is that we don t really know what the created
in his image means i ve heard a number of different opinions on this and
have still not come to any conclusion this rather upsets the apple cart if
one wants to base a life script on this shaky foundation to mix metaphors
unashamedly as to living by christ s example we know very little about
jesus as a person we only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives
by his followers and some very small references from comtemporary historians revelation aside one can only know christ second hand or worse this is not an attempt to debunk christianity although it may seem that way
initially the point i m trying to make is that we only really have the bible
to interpret and that interpretation is by humanity i guess this is where
faith or relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness no there may be an absolute moral code there are undoubtably multiple
moral codes the multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral
code as an example a parent may tell a child never to swear and the child
may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told
the child that it is wrong now the parent may swear like a trooper in
the pub or bar where there are no children the wrongness here is if
the child disobeys the parent the parent may feel that it is inappropriate to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of
animals the analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that
he is of the same type as the parent and may be a parent later in life but
you get the gist of it incidentally the young child considers the directive
as absolute until he gets older see piaget and learns a morality of his own david"
83460.eml,talk.religion.misc,"i think that you are changing the meaning of values here perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word value n a fair equivalent or return for something such as goods
or service monetary or material worth worth as measured in usefulness or importance merit a principle standard or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable precise meaning as
of a word an assigned or calculated numerical quantity mus the relative duratation of a tone or rest the relative darkness or
lightness of a color the distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound in context of a moral system definition four seems to fit best in terms
of scientific usage definitions six or eight might apply note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing in my mind to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach science has its basis in observable fact even the usages of the
word value above do not denote observable fact but rather a standard
of measurement i would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values and so your statement above fails in fact if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements values are based on
systems derived from observation then it must follow that in a
scientific context there is no such thing as there is no such thing as objective values back to the present this has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow just because the word values is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts if one is to argue for objective values in a moral sense then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective considering
the meaning of the word objective i doubt that this will ever happen so back to the original question and objective morality is if you can provide an objective foundation for morality then that will
be a good beginning eric"

about the only true god whom you interpret according to your own likes

him myself i guess your grandiose self image does not allow for other
faiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a different
way or fashion than your own not that it really matters the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited
every continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear this is really a red herring it doesn t address any issue raised but rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read something into the bible doesn t change what the bible teaches sigh what the bible teaches or what the bible teaches according to
robert weiss and co i respect the former i reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus on the contrary and by
the way i do respect your interpretations of the bible i even grant you

christian following my own image of him in my heart most of the other replies have instead hop scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i don t think that it matters if mcconkie s views were canon that is not the issue were mcconkie s writings indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may certainly be the issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis represent or ridicule the lds church the issue of official doctrine is obviously very important mcconkie s views have been controversial e g the seven deadly heresies has made me a heretic at best or erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation i respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church but i personally do not rely on his personal
interpretations his book mormon doctrine is oftentimes referred to
as mcconkie s bible in mormon circles on mormon doctrine i rather
look to official doctrinal sources and to hugh nibley s books the last comment is an lds insider reference summarizing mcconkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
god than i have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation but having said this i find mcconkie even in his most

purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your right with non related scriptures lots of nice scriptures deleted not robert w copyrighted though ra we are told that and this is life eternal that they might know ra thee the only true god and jesus christ whom thou hast sent ra john life eternal is to know the only true god yet the ra doctrines of the lds that i have mentioned portray a vastly ra different jesus a jesus that cannot be reconciled with the jesus of ra the bible they are so far removed from each other that to proclaim correction my jesus is indeed different than your jesus and can be
reconciled with the jesus in the bible not your interpretation of him i concur but i honestly couldn t care less ra one as being true denies the other from being true according to the ra bible eternal life is dependent on knowing the only true god and ra not the construct of imagination in this single posting of yours i ve seen more constructs of imagination than in all of the pro lds mails combined i have read so far in this news
group first get your lds facts straight before you dare preaching to us
about the only true god whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes but whose image i cannot reconcile with what i know about
him myself i guess your grandiose self image does not allow for other
faiths believing in the divinity of jesus christ but in a different
way or fashion than your own not that it really matters the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on boldly and nobly and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing until it has visited
every continent swept every clime and sounded in every ear this is really a red herring it doesn t address any issue raised but rather it seeks to obfuscate the fact that some groups try to read something into the bible doesn t change what the bible teaches sigh what the bible teaches or what the bible teaches according to
robert weiss and co i respect the former i reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that i have rejected jesus on the contrary and by
the way i do respect your interpretations of the bible i even grant you
being a christian following your own image of him as much as i am a
christian following my own image of him in my heart most of the other replies have instead hop scotched to the issue of bruce mcconkie and whether his views were official doctrine i don t think that it matters if mcconkie s views were canon that is not the issue were mcconkie s writings indicative of mormon belief on this subject is the real issue the indication from rick is that they may certainly be the issue is of course that you love to use anything to either mis represent or ridicule the lds church the issue of official doctrine is obviously very important mcconkie s views have been controversial e g the seven deadly heresies has made me a heretic at best or erroneous at worst blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation i respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church but i personally do not rely on his personal
interpretations his book mormon doctrine is oftentimes referred to
as mcconkie s bible in mormon circles on mormon doctrine i rather
look to official doctrinal sources and to hugh nibley s books the last comment is an lds insider reference summarizing mcconkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
god than i have but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation but having said this i find mcconkie even in his most
biased and speculative moments far more thought provoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen i m somewhat appalled that i have

of individuals quoting a man is not the same as quoting the
order taken out of context words can be interpreted much
differently than had one applied them within the confines of
their original expression i think this is the case regarding hymenaeus beta frater superior of the order to which i belong when he included that bit
from merlinus x he did us all a service he showed us the extremes
to which order members have been known to go in their fervor i have little knowledge regarding reuss background but surely
he was an unusual man and he was an important force in the order for many years yet as people change so do orders change and while we look back
so carefully at the dirty laundry of o t o remember that this is
only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed
which extend beyond any one individual i hope to show that there
was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the order
itself perhaps by testing the limits myself let us examine this issue a bit more closely in karl kellner a wealthy austrian industrialist
and paper chemist as well as a high grade mason founded the ordo
templi orientis kellner had traveled widely in the east where he
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices kellner s efforts to develop the order were later assisted by franz
hartmann heinrich klein and theodore reuss who had worked together
prior to joining the o t o the order was first proclaimed in in reuss s masonic publication oriflamme on kellner s death reuss succeeded him as outer head o h o the jubilee edition of
the oriflamme published in announced that the order taught
secret of sexual magic theodore reuss was an interesting character born june in
augsburg he entered masonry in he was a singer journalist and
possibly a spy for the prussian political police infiltrating the socialist
league founded by karl marx s daughter and her husband reuss was
later associated with william wynn westcott a leader of the golden
dawn who later introduced him to john yarker yarker chartered reuss to
found the rites of memphis and mizraim in germany after several
attempts to concretize various masonic rites reuss settled on the
development of the o t o the order experienced reasonably steady growth under reuss leadership for example he chartered papus in france rudolph steiner in berlin
and h spencer lewis in the usa in the historic meeting between
reuss and crowley occurred crowley wrote that reuss came to him and
accused him of revealing order secrets when crowley looked at it afresh the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for
the first time reuss appointed crowley as supreme and holy king of all
the english speaking world and it was this authorization that he invoked
when publishing the material of the equinox reuss resigned as outer head of the order in after suffering a
stroke and named crowley his successor all was well until when the book of the law was translated into german there was a break
in the continuity of the order manyk members split with the new o h o over the book which crowley was actively promulgating through the order he had earlier revise dthe order rituals at reuss s request deeply
infusing the doctrines of the new aeon revelation an introduction to the history of the o t o by ad veritatem ix within equinox iii edited by hymenaeus beta frater superior rex summus sanctissimus caliph of the united states of america published by samuel weiser there are many possible reasons that our frater superior included this
material in equinox iii and this is the real point is it not why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own
organization does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle
of thelema or is he exercising his true will and putting forth very
complex pictures with no easy answers a picture which leaves room
for very many interpretations it is quite easy for me to see for example that all of o t o derived
out of the dribble of faltering masonry purchased by clever hucksters
with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them and i
can take that all the way down to our present caliph whose feeble
support of the law of thelema is laughable at best would i be thrown out of the order for speaking in this way will i i think not why because my frater will see it as a perspective an interjection
i am using as an example my illustration shows that we may express things
in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be
quite difficult to apprehend at first so it may be with oto and merlinus x please look o t o more carefully i do not support reuss s words myself as i am not qualified to assess
them and i am critical of their pomposity if i who am a member of
the order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so then
what can this say about the health of the order does it mean that
the order has gone soft and abandoned its moral principles or
does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of
universal kinship arise on its own not shackled by some dogmatic
requirement how shall we resolve these two possibilities i find a high calibre of individual associated with ordo templi orientis they are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane
or usual information they are quite often artists and geniuses having met some longstanding members in the sf bay area many who are or
were very heavily involved with the order i can vouch for the integrity
of the organization as it stands i have sometimes questioned the policy of hymenaeus beta in these moments i followed my intuition and i ve found little to stop me from requesting
a second initiation from a different o t o body i m happily participating
in social groups feasts or initiations and have come to know the gnostic
mass well enough for my tastes this doesn t make me an authority on order politics and explanations however i can only hypothesize and relay to you what i understand based on my
limited contact with other members i urge you not to take the words of merlinus x too far there are many
ways to interpret words and many people who have become involved with
the order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom
and the preservation of individual vision i welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response

not trustworthy by scholarly standards and others why an insert read it i have a number of times the passage is glaringly
out of context and josephus a superb writer had no such problem elsewhere in his work the passage has nothing to do with the subject matter in which it lies it suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about
the josephus insert your proof is meaningless and it should not be repeated
here what s more even if josephus happened to be legitimate it would prove nothing scholars speak of the weight of evidence far more independent
evidence would be required to validate your claim until forthcoming your
belief is based on faith that s ok but you exceed your rights when you pass

inconsistencies and contradictions shouldn t a perfect canon be perfect shouldn t there be absolutely no room for debate i suggest you read gospel fictions by randel helms and the unauthorized version by robin fox for herb huston no known kinship or familial relationship but we do indeed share an evolutionary ancestry the fact that there are inconsistencies gaps and contradictions does not deny
your position on the other hand neither do the gospels prove your faith independent evidence is necessary and i know of none which we have already
discussed and so far you have not provided any until then its faith moreover you have committed a fundamental error in logic you have attempted
to prove your claim with that which you want to prove its no different than
saying i am right because i say so your logic is full of circles it reminds me a bit of the presbyterian general assembly the assembly defined five fundamentals this is where fundamentalist came from of orthodox protestant christianity to wit jesus performed miracles jesus was born of a virgin jesus was bodily
resurrected jesus crucifixion atoned for human sin and here is the

jews which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung ho
for jesus and may be authentic there is no question that origen in the third century saw a reference
to jesus in josephus there are no manuscripts of antiquities which
lack the references it is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted but
i don t think it s very likely nor do i think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case i know g a wells takes

83528.eml,talk.religion.misc,"stop hold it you have a few problems here official history says that the first accusations of homosexuality in the sa came from outside of the nazi party long before the nazis ever came to power so this objection is a red
herring even if established history is wrong on this point moreover none of the histories i ve read ever made mention of hitler or anyone else ever using homosexuality as a pretext for purging roehm a point i saw reiterated was that
hitler and the party covered up these accusations if you are going to accuse
official history of being a fabrication you should at least get your facts
right the pretext for purging roehm was that he was planning to use the sa in
a coup against hitler nowhere is there mention of using allegations of
homosexuality as a pretext for the purge nor as a justification afterwards it
is possible that the histories i ve read have not mentioned this but i doubt
it would it be in hitler s best interest to admit to the world that his
former right hand man was a homosexual anyway as i said before it is always possible that i have missed references to the nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the sa after the night of the long knives but this does not prove that they were false even the nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage in any case this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the sa during the s ah yes i forgot this was being posted to alt conspiracy i can smell the
paranoia from here since the nazis never officially charged roehm with homosexuality at least not according to what i ve read i d like to know what tainted evidence you are talking about since the accusations were made by persons outside of the nazi party long before it came to power and those accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in germany in the s and s just how would it be possible for the nazis to go back in time and plant tainted evidence how exactly does one doctor newspapers which were circulated around the world without the discrepancies being obvious what actual incidences of nazi doctoring evidence on this matter
do you know about and what about the testimony of people who were involved in these matters some of whom were not nazis and what is the point of making a false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it since the point here seems to be to discredit established history then the burden of proof falls on the revisionist the revisionists had better do their homework before making accusations otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts this is just about the only thing we agree on i suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people roehm and his sa buddies who were homosexuals must disturb some people the feeling
seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality that this
must be an attempt to bash homosexuals this fear often justified is what
lies behind this distrust of official history or so it seems to me but this
is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject if you really think that historians are so incompetent why don t you write them and ask where they got their sources on this subject if you can t tell from their footnotes i m a graduate student in history writing to professors and
tracking down sources is old hat but my time is limited and this is not my
specialty and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence i m not going to waste my time
trying to debunk someone s paranoia do the research yourself given that you already consider all evidence tainted what on earth would
constitute concrete particulars and since when have concrete particulars been
considered shrewd guesses i suggest that those who do not trust popular historians irving et al historians writing for a popular audience do not as a rule provide copious footnotes should try instead reading academic historians who usually provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail this is the place to start looking assuming that one really wants to know the truth i ll bet the folks on alt pagan are tired of this subject already my

83529.eml,talk.religion.misc,"i think the passage you re looking for is the following matthew think not that i have come to abolish the law and the prophets i have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them matthew for truly i say to you till heaven and earth pass away not an iota not a dot will pass from the law until all is accomplished matthew whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven matthew for i tell you unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and pharisees you will never enter the kingdom of heaven there are several problems with this the most serious is that the
law was regarded by jews at the time and now as binding on jews but
not on gentiles there are rules that were binding on all human
beings the so called noachic laws but they are quite minimal the
issue that the church had to face after jesus death was what to do
about gentiles who wanted to follow christ the decision not to
impose the law on them didn t say that the law was abolished it
simply acknowledged that fact that it didn t apply to gentiles this
is a simple answer which i think just about everyone can agree to a discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded
in acts however there s more involved in order to get a full picture of the
role of the law we have to come to grips with paul s apparent
rejection of the law and how that relates to jesus commendation of
the law at least as i read paul he says that the law serves a
purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded again this
issue isn t one of the abolition of the law in the middle of his
discussion paul notes that he might be understood this way and
assures us that that s not what he intends to say rather he sees
the law as primarily being present to convict people of their
sinfulness but ultimately it s an impossible standard and one that
has been superceded by christ paul s comments are not the world s
clearest here and not everyone agrees with my reading but the
interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does
not entail an abolition of the law it still remains as an
uncompromising standard from which not an iota or dot may be removed for its purpose of convicting of sin it s important that it not be
relaxed however for christians it s not the end ultimately we
live in faith not law while the theoretical categories they use are rather different in the
end i think jesus and paul come to a rather similar conclusion the
quoted passage from mat should be taken in the context of the rest
of the sermon on the mount where jesus shows us how he interprets the
law the not an iota or dot would suggest a rather literal reading but in fact that s not jesus approach jesus interpretations
emphasize the intent of the law and stay away from the ceremonial
details indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude
towards the sabbath and kosher laws some scholars claim that mat needs to be taken in the context of st cent jewish
discussions jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a
tenth of even the most minor herbs but neglecting the things that
really matter justice mercy and faith and caring about how cups and
plates are cleaned but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full of extortion and rapacity mat this and
the discussion later in mat suggest that jesus has a very specific
view of the law in mind and that when he talks about maintaining the
law in its full strength he is thinking of these aspects of it paul s conclusion is similar while he talks about the law being
superceded all of the specific examples he gives involve the ceremonial law such as circumcision and the sabbath he is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards the net result of this is that when paul talks about the law being
superceded and jesus talks about the law being maintained i believe
they are talking about different aspects of the law paul is
embroiled in arguments about circumcision as is natural in letters
responding to specific situations he s looking at the aspect of the
law that is currently causing trouble the law as specifically jewish
ceremonies he certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards
of conduct on the other hand when jesus commends the law he seems
to be talking the law in its broadest implications for morals and
human relationships and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
to give paul so much trouble it s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways but
we should be familiar with that from current conflicts look at the
way terms like family values take on special meaning from the
current context imagine some poor historian of the future trying to
figure out why family values should be used as a code word for
opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the u s i
think law had taken on a similar role in the arguments paul was
involved in paul was clearly not rejecting all of the jewish values
that go along with the term law any more than people who concerned
about the family values movement are really opposed to family
values"

83547.eml,talk.religion.misc,"tony i read your post it was nothing new i had seen much the same in other
typical christian anti gay sentimental literature gay people are and will
con tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates you may
be unaware of all the statistica findings concerning african americans that
have been published and used by various groups to re enforce their own bias
against african americans we usually think of the kkk in these instances but there are many other groups of course the vast majority of the public
scoff at such findings and documents today but that was not always the case fortunately african americans had whites who supported their cause and
public sentiment was eventually if not entirely turned around there was
even a civil war and anti negro sentiment increased in fact until laws
were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of blacks it was pretty
much legal to discriminate against them i know many gays and i will not turn my back on them or their right to be free
form discrimination you may think that i have been deceived or something that is your perogative my church christian church disciples of christ openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society including gays we believe the gospel message of preaching to all creation
and making disciples we believe in the lord s great commandment to love and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed even if it is not popular
to do so i really like my church for last reason the most i can find a
church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the gospel and believes
in the commandment of love though i m hard pressed to find many who actually
sho love but not many are willing to champion the oppressed especially
within their own community i may have lost face with the greater christian
community for the unpopularity of my beliefs but so did the abolitionists
against the oppression of african americans many were even killed and
treated as runaway slaves for being nigger lovers and such i guess i ve
decided the challenge is worth it in my talks with gay men and women i have heard tragic story after tragic
story centering around failed marriages wives and husbands who are straight
who have been hurt in the process etc funny thing is i don t know of one
case where the parents ex wives or even children have continued to reject
their gay family member son daughter ex husband father etc after they
began to take part in some form of support group like pflag i m apalled by the legislation which passed in colorado and am equally out raged that such slimey people as louis sheldon from the tradition values
coalition have been actively working in the christian underground to garner
support within several i believe states this coming november for more
oppressive legisation against gays perhaps you don t get it and maybe you never will many didn t get it in the
middle ages and the proclaimed god s will be done as they massacred thousands
in witch hunts and inquisitions the message that comes through loud and clear by proponents against gay
rights and against gays in general is that there is a strong dislike even
hatred for gays whether you want to call it such or not it doesn t change
the results the major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end the
final effect of posts like that of yours and mr hudson is that you have a conditional love for gays condition change and we ll love you this is
sure strange coming from a group who claim that god has an unconditional love one that calls people just as they are sure there are things that
will naturally change and habits like alcoholism wife beating etc that
need to be changed through some sort of therapy but then there are things
like left handedness etc that no amount of beating it out of people is
going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to other
people s expectations in the process this coerced conformity causes many
people a great deal of harm especially when it is caused by people who have
nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their
own sense of pseuper spirituality this is sad but i thoroughly believe that one day it will change it may be
unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with
something very personal like sexuality a taboo subject even today but i
firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation
on thier bedrooms it s funny that most straight people have successfully
removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression as though it
helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society gay people are not criminals another interesting thing happened recently a very prominent charismatic
church in the silicon valley here had two of it s pastors arrested for self admitted charges of pederasty men having sex with boys this had apparently
been going on for some time a couple years but since the charges were
voluntary and the church worked closely with the police so i imagine that
was how they managed to downplay it in the media how could such a thing
happen when the church itself has an ex gay ministry one of my friends
recently told me he was approached by someone who is going through the
reparitive therapy there and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for
dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry these are difficult times we live in but providing hostile environments and
creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not
the call of the christian community the results of the passing amendment in
colorado has created an organization who s posters are appearing all over
colorado called s t r a i g h t i forget the whole definition off hand but the last part was against immoral gross homosexual trash and their motto
is working for a fag free america with an implicit advocation for violence this is sick and it seems to be what you and mr hudson and others are
embracing we christians have a loooooooooong tradition of coersion and oppression
towards those we feel don t measure up and constant beratement from
organizations like the christian research institute while they do have a good
purpose also their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of
excluding people the gospel i believe is not so negative rather it seeks ways to include people i have several of dr martin s books and find them quite helpful especially concerning cults but it seems that cri has become a cult unto
itself why don t we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people

point of the original question in this thread i e can we toss out
christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own
principles if you will bear with me i will attempt to explain this
apparent inconsistency from at least one christian s viewpoint if god exists and is the creator of mankind as the bible claims then
he has a pretty well defined concept of what makes people tick
physically emotionally etc god has an objective morality for us that is to say he has no trouble understanding what is good for or
detrimental to the creature he created galatians for we mankind are his workmanship created in christ jesus for good works a morality which god prepared beforehand a well defined design that we might walk in them however contrary to what many people assume including the pharasees
of the bible god s morality cannot be completely codified in a list
of rules and regulations to some extent every activity of a
person s life creates a new situation to which morality must be
applied there never could be enough volumes to codify god s objective morality for us throughout history mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of
rules objectivity if you please in the old testament we have
both principles and specific rules by the time of jesus most of the
principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the
application of the principles we mankind weren t comfortable with
the subjectivity of principles for reference see matthew where jesus explains the difference between the law and the principles of the law for example in verses you have heard that the ancients were told you shall not commit murder and whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court but i say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the court the objective morality of god gets blurred by our inept
interpretation of it we christians have made our biggest errors
when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide exactly
what god intended for us if we christians would stay committed to
seeking god s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all
figured out we might do a better job of allowing others to find god s objective morality for themselves if jesus is who he said he
was is and that s the fundamental question then he is objective

can write both the gentle words paul uses of it in corinthians in
a passage that even the conservatives will quote at you and the
words of t s eliot in his pentacost hymn love is the unfamiliar name
that wove the intolerable shirt of flame this is in any case rather to the side of what i was attempting to raise
in my note as will become more evident below blechhh i think you are misreading me rather seriously though given my principle that one cannot force one s own notion of sin on
another and my unshakeable disestablishmentarianism russel turpin
and others believers and unbelievers alike are under no threat of my
legislating my own understanding of christian love you misread i can do and have repeatedly done a complete bill of
accusation against the inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
beings in the first place and to respect for let alone love of god in near succession please go back to my quoted words above the possibility that always exists is that i or to revert to proper
time sequence my predecessors over the last several centuries could
persuade christian b of my case that the inquisition does indeed
constitute an egregious violation of the law of love i must also note
that the majority of christians have been so persuaded by christian
argumentation as well as by secular both christian and non christian prohibitions what mr turpin alludes to is a trickier point a i demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved in the inquisition b the inquisitor responds that mother church must however painful this seems discipline her children for their own good in this case the salvation of their souls or if the tortured heretic will not recant than by bad example deterring others from the same loss of soul a i point out that this justification of a failure in love depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable b burns me at the stake my rhetoric has failed but the point i am making is sustained what is
going on here has a lot to do with cultural baggage in this case the baggage includes a nearly universal and absolutely secular belief
that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
believable if taken under torture the elimination of inqisitorial
practice in those places where it has been eliminated or at least
greatly reduced has very little if anything to do with the discussion
of sin in the exchange between a and b mr turpin is pointing out that if i am a versus the grand inquisitor s b then my persuasion is not very likely to work i know this and in what ever personal agony i consign the issue to god and my ghostly defense
attorney so one possibility fails in this case as it will fail in
may others at the other extreme the persuasion will succeed when it
properly should not if it entails mistaken assumptions i share with the
inquisitor and that is potentially an even more troubling case in that
many of the victims of inquisition will have accepted that they were in
fact sinful in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
of charges brought against them the point is that the persuasion breaks down when the parties do not
share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage and given the main
thrust of the inquisition against heresy it is bound to break down
in precisely the worst cases the conservative i don t think that
is the right word btw will take refuge in what i attribute to b above that he is justified in causing harm because he thinks that works to
a greater good but this is a violent and extravagant refusal to follow
the gospel as if one s theories about sin entitled one to cast aside
jesus words on dealing with sinners cf matthew ff i am a radical christian only in that i take the gospel seriously well the whole point of making these the base commandments is that
they aren t reducible to rules a set of rules is a moral code or a
law code or an algorithm for acting such things can be very helpful
to individuals or societies but not if they are used instead of a
personal involvement in and responsibility for one s actions the great
commandment is more than anything else a call to act as if you were
god and accepting ultimate responsibility in your every action a
demand that i like most would rather not hear but it keeps popping
up nonetheless along with the reassurance that it is more important
that i be open to trying this than succeeding at it conservatives may twist this act as if you were god to mean lay down rules for other
people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don t keep your rules they are so insistent and obvious about this that they have convinced a
lot of people who rightly reject the whole concept that such idiocy
is how god acts that after all is the standard accusation against
god by the atheists here and elsewhere that the conservatives have
confused their manipulative hoop jumping notions of coercing other
people with the nature of god is almost the entire content of standard
american atheism and i quite agree with it on this point and different bodies of christians have from the beginning urged different ethical systems or in some cases none as a result it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems however popular or infamous with christianity christianity does not have a torah it does not have a qu ran specifically christian scripture has very
little if anything in the way of commandments so little that
the christians who desperately want commandments go mining for
them with almost no support and thus almost no obvious limitation for their efforts the one single thing in the gospels which jesus
specifically gives as a commandment to us is love one another i will be expanding on this point in a reply to paul hudson that i hope to get to in a day or so it is quite true that some christians infer lots of commandments from the nt i ll point out what has to be going on in these inferences and why there is a huge amount of cultural baggage involved you are quite right that this is goo if one is looking for an ethical
system but why should anyone be looking for an ethical system since our
society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do it
may be that we need a principle for the critique of ethical systems in which case i will profer the agapate allelou once again i think you are begging the question why don t i and the myriads
of other christians like me tell you something about christianity nor is this very new in christianity you might want to look up
the origins and fundamental doctrines of the quakers from the th
century onwards and they are not at all the first to understand the
gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case"
